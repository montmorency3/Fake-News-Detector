aleppo ended the struggle of the one who stayed in the city to reopen his factory show why the other will not return yet from the security of neighboring jordan restoring the aleppo industry that have for decade underpinned syria s economy is vital if president bashar alassad is to turn battlefield success into a fuller return of state power moustafa kawai who remained in aleppo moved his cottonweaving machine to a temporary site but now ha worker clearing his battered factory of debris to reopen it our biggest problem is electricity there are also very few worker because everyone s in the army sanction affect the work customer can t come here transferring money is difficult it s hard to buy spare part he said mahmoud akkad a carpet manufacturer who like many aleppo industrialist left syria during the war face no such problem in jordan where he ha rebuilt his plant and kept up export to old customer around the world what do i benefit if i want to set up a factory and there is no safety he said explaining the benefit of moving to an industrial zone in a country unaffected by middle east turmoil the international monetary fund estimated last year that syria s economy had shrunk by percent during the conflict and it manufacturing sector by percent the war ha since gone better for assad a his army and it ally pushed rebel from aleppo and other enclave near important city and islamic state from energy field growing confidence is evident in a new banknote bearing assad s face for the first time and in damascus holding it onceannual trade fair after a long hiatus but the war still dominates syria s economy even where the fighting ha stopped most aleppo factory were destroyed badly damaged or looted their worker fled a refugee or became combatant despite a new power line to the city there is little electricity leaving people reliant on expensive diesel generator water must be pumped electrically fighting continues outside aleppo the army and allied militia who control the city operate checkpoint that some syrian say demand bribe to let good or worker pas a charge the military denies travel outside the city mean using narrow road to bypass rebel territory and more checkpoint western sanction make foreign trade much harder hindering the purchase of new equipment and payment for commercial deal although the government urge industry to return to area where it ha regained control some businessmen say it is not doing enough to bring them back fare shehabi the head of aleppo s chamber of industry said that since the fighting ended the number of factory and workshop had risen sharply before the war there were he said when the rebel left in december there were there are now he said attributing the rise to returning industrialist who are restarting their business but shehabi a supporter of assad who ha been sanctioned by the european union for backing the government is also critical of it reconstruction policy there are some incentive but not enough he said during an interview citing tax deduction and reduced custom tariff for industrial import for all syrian customer a thing the government ha done there were no specific incentive offered for aleppo they should treat u like a devastated area we don t have the level of administration that is needed to really save this industry to make it run again he added in jordan akkad said the syrian government had encouraged him to return and he said he hope to do so eventually it all depends on the circumstance improving he said he ha built one factory that produce most of the same range of rug and carpet he once made in aleppo and is also investing in a new  million plant to make yarn some of his most skilled weaver followed him to jordan and few others remain in aleppo only five percent of my workforce have remained most headed to germany to turkey he said in aleppo had about a third of syria s industrial company and industry worker central bureau of statistic figure show there were about a million people employed in it factory shehabi said during the decade before the war assad s economic reform helped aleppo s business to grow more quickly akkad wa among the first to leave the small inner city workshop and move his operation into sheikh najjar north of aleppo the biggest industrial zone in the city his family owned three factory there and wa one of the biggest exporter of syrian textile sheikh najjar became a battlefield in occupied by successive force whose warfare caused massive damage and who stripped plant of equipment akkad risked losing business relationship built over year today you have customer all over the world this is very costly to get a new network of customer it s more expensive than the plant itself he said he considered starting again in turkey lebanon or egypt some city industrialist have moved to each of the three country and others went elsewhere in syria but akkad chose jordan untouched by the arab uprising his business is now located in a wellpoliced industrial zone there the machine gun of jordan s antiterrorist force guarding the entrance what brought u here wa the security he said when rebel took over moustafa kawai s factory in he bought new machine and started producing on a temporary site in a governmentheld district of aleppo instead of moving away that site  which still represents his entire

whirred and rattled in a cramped room plasticwrapped bale of white cotton lay to one side electricity is provided by a diesel generator and cost syrian pound  a week to power five machine it often stop working by comparison in his large purposebuilt factory before the war he paid pound a week to power machine in the belleramoun industrial zone in west aleppo the pound wa worth about time more against the dollar than it is now he also had spacious loading bay and other facility there that he lack in the temporary site like much of sheikh najjar belleramoun is now a wasteland of shellpocked building mostly empty but for army checkpoint still kawai ha started work to move back outside his factory six hand were shifting rubble with spade on a street that abruptly ended a hundred yard away

this guy just want everyone deadpastor steven anderson of faithful word baptist church in arizona just doe not know how to shut his mouththe day after the orlando mass shooting anderson praised the murder and called upon the government to execute all gay people across the nationjust this past sunday anderson repeated his call to execute gay people but added a call to purge any christian who support the lgbt communityand now anderson is calling for reinstating the death penalty against anyone who is tried and convicted of committing adultery adultery is not a crime in the united state but anderson called for punishing those who commit it with death in a written manifesto on his blog last week when someone say that homosexuality is worthy of death according to the bible people inevitably will bring up other sin that were also punishable by death in the old testament he wrote they think they are somehow catching u in hypocrisy but the truth is bible believing christian do agree with those other old testament penalty a well we just need to realize that god s law were the law of the land in those day today adultery is not punishable by law in the united state but it should be just a he did when he called for executing gay people anderson laid out his vision of a righteous government presumably made up of conservative christian who will shred the constitution and replace it with the bible and said such a government would make adultery a capital crime worthy of arrest and death if convicted by what one can only imagine would be a kangaroo court this anderson say is the way he would prevent adultery and divorceyes a righteous government would implement the death penalty for those tried and convicted of adultery we all know normal people who have unfortunately committed this grievous sin and of course we wouldn t want them to die for it if we were to somehow vote in a law making adultery illegal it would not be retroactive it would be the law going forward and adultery rate would plummet and so would divorce rate think about it though do you really think a many people commit adultery in society where it is punishable by death of course not so you can relax about your aunt trudy who cheated on her husband thirty year ago if aunt trudy had lived in a society that enforced the death penalty for adultery chance are she would never have committed that sin in the first placeindeed other nation in the world do in fact punish adulterer with death there s only one problemas it turn out punishing adultery by execution is something that occurs today mostly under islamic law conservative like anderson would refer to this a sharia law and usually it overwhelmingly punishes woman especially woman who have been rapedaccording to the weekthe un ha issued numerous call to government to repeal law that criminalise adultery arguing that they are predominantly used to discriminate against woman provision in penal code often do not treat woman and men equally and establish harsher rule and sanction for woman writes human right expert france radaycountries governed by islamic law including saudi arabia pakistan and somalia all strictly prohibit zina or fornication outside marriage prosecution are common and punishment can include fine arbitrary detention imprisonment flogging and in extreme case the death penalty woman are overwhelmingly targetedhuman right organisation argue that in several muslim nation adultery law are often used against woman who have been raped under such legislation the burden of proof is on the woman to provide evidence that she wa raped or be prosecuted for adulteryin short what anderson is proposing is a barbaric practice that is mostly practiced in country that are governed by some form of sharia law and is used primarily to punish womenbasically he is calling for the united state to be governed by christian sharia law you know the same sharia law that conservative freak out about and pas law againstanderson concluded his sermon by claiming that the death penalty deters crime and shrugged at the notion that people don t want their loved one executed just because they had an extramarital affairin country where adultery is still a capital crime it s not an everyday occurrence and usually end up in the news just a capital punishment is a strong deterrent against murder it ha the same effect on other crimestelling u that we would not want people we know and care about to be put to death is a straw man argument we don t want our friend and family to be convicted of murder either but they probably won t kill anyone so we don t worry about it when the child of israel committed adultery they knew the risk going inhowever it s worth noting that multiple study by researcher have been unable to prove that the death penalty is a deterrent to crimethe bottom line is that is that anderson is a maniac who want to bathe america in blood in order to create what he considers the perfect christian utopia million upon million of american would be murdered in this endeavor if anderson had his way and that is precisely why conservative christian can never be allowed to have power in our governmentfeatured image screenshot,1,0,0.0,2,122,377,899,683,187,29,39.0,67.16666667,203.1666667,4.77753059,0,conservative christian preacher want government to execute

who with and how long they will take to get going although a surprise cannot be ruled out in the wake of any russian interference pollster say they are confident about their survey which show merkel s conservative winning the most seat in the bundestag lower house the farright antiimmigrant alternative for germany afd is set to enter parliament for the first time and some expert have said it may gain more support than the roughly percent poll suggest an alarming prospect for many at home and abroad but all the other party have ruled out joining it in a coalition  an inherent part of germany s electoral system  and the most likely scenario is probably a repeat of merkel s grand coalition with the social democrat spd she will start sounding out partner right after the sept vote but coalition building is a protracted process which could paralyze policy for month at a time when brexit ha shaken europe s foundation the process is especially complex this time a the number of parliamentary group could rise to six from four informal sounding and then exploratory talk precede formal coalition negotiation and party leader may also seek approval from their member before signing off on any deal depending on the shape of the coalition the main issue at stake are the integration of the more than million migrant who have arrived in germany in the last two year and investment in europe s biggest economy a well a merkel s leading role in talk on reform of the european union and relation with russia and turkey here are the main scenario conservative social democrat grand coalition the most likely option according to opinion poll merkel s parliamentary party made up of her christian democrat cdu and the bavarian christian social union csu ha governed with the spd for eight of the year that merkel ha been chancellor including the last four what make it possible merkel who ha steered the conservative towards the political center ground look comfortable ruling with the spd such a coalition would likely have a large majority provide continuity and broadly agree on europe turkey foreign policy migration and security issue hurdle it is a last resort for both side especially the spd which fear it will lose out a junior partner it want more emphasis on investment education tackling inequality and fair pension while conservative are more focused on tax cut the spd is also reluctant to back planned defense spending hike conservative free democrat blackyellow the conservative block and probusiness free democrat fdp are traditional partner especially on financial and economic policy having ruled together for almost half of postwar germany s seven decade if they win sufficient vote this is the most likely scenario what make it possible the probusiness fdp ha rebounded this year winning enough vote in a vote in germany s most populous state north rhinewestphalia in may to share power with the cdu there a repeat at federal level would herald tax cut and deregulation and possibly tighter law on immigration asylum seeking and security hurdle the fdp wa wiped out of parliament in after four chaotic year ruling with merkel it ha more radical tax reduction and privatization plan opposes deeper eu integration and want eu country to be able to quit the euro zone party leader christian lindner ha also suggested germany accept russia s annexation of crimea from ukraine something merkel ha ruled out conservative fdp green jamaica  reference to party color black yellow green a yet untested at a federal level this combination rule in the northern state of schleswigholstein what make it possible  if merkel s bloc can t form an alliance with the fdp or the green alone it may try a threeway deal both smaller party have played down this option but may be lured by the prospect of power hurdle  the green and fdp are at opposite end of the political spectrum policy clash would be likely on tax energy the eu and migrant conservative green blackgreen untested at a federal level this ha been mooted a an option under merkel who ha pushed renewable energy the cdu and green have worked together at regional level including in a greensled coalition in the rich southern state of badenwuerttemberg what make it possible the green leader are pragmatic world away from the ecowarriors who founded the party the prospect of power may persuade them to compromise such a coalition would promote a strong europe and focus on fighting climate change the green would push for a phaseout of coalfired power station hurdle doubtful they would win a majority conservative want lower tax while green want to tax the super rich green have a more liberal migrant policy which could pit them against the csu and they oppose plan to increase defense spending clash are also likely on some aspect of energy policy and auto emission regulation following the diesel scandal a minority government would be a first and stabilitycraving german would not like it but may prefer it to new election what make it possible if merkel fails to find a partner she may feel she ha a mandate to rule given her personal popularity she would probably get support for individual policy from the fdp spd and green hurdle merkel s natural caution coupled with german fear of instability a legacy of the fragmentation in the year that preceded the rise of hitler s nazi party spd left green redredgreen or rg highly unlikely never tested at a federal level a tie up between the spd and green preferred partner and the radical left party could be the only way for the spd to take the chancellery it is being tested in the state of berlin under spd leadership and with a left premier in the state of thuringia what make it possible for the first time the spd ha not excluded the possibility of joining the left such a coalition would probably focus on boosting investment and tackling inequality and adopt a more russiafriendly stance hurdle the left s link with communist in former east germany and painful spd memory of an exodus to the left over deep labor market reform more than a decade ago while the spd and green could rule together relatively easily the left want a top tax rate of percent a hour week and to replace nato with an alliance including russia for an interactive on german election click

frankfurt an der oder germany reuters  the first farright party set to enter germany s parliament for more than a half a century say it will press for chancellor angela merkel to be severely punished for opening the door to refugee and migrant the alternative for germany afd which ha also called for germany s immigration minister to be disposed of in turkey where her parent come from could become the third largest party with up to percent of the vote on sept poll show that is far less than similar movement in other european country  in france farright leader marine le pen won percent of the vote in may and in the netherlands farrightist geert wilder scored percent in a march election but the prospect of a party that the foreign minister ha compared with the nazi entering the heart of german democracy is unnerving the other party they all refuse to work with the afd and no one want to sit next to them in parliament leading afd candidate alexander gauland denies they are nazi saying others only use the term because of the party s popularity it ha won support with call for germany to shut it border immediately introduce a minimum quota for deportation and stop refugee bringing their family here we re gradually becoming foreigner in our own country gauland told an election rally in the polish border city of frankfurt an der oder a song with the lyric we ll bring happiness back to your homeland blared out of a blue campaign bus and the yearold lawyer said germany belonged to the german islam had no place here and the migrant influx would make everyone worse off gauland provoked outrage for saying at another event that german should no longer be reproached with the nazi past and they should take pride in what their soldier achieved during world war one and two the nazi ruled germany from to during which time they killed million jew in the holocaust and invaded country across europe the afd could end up a the biggest opposition force in the national assembly if there is a rerun of the current coalition of merkel s conservative and social democrat spd one of the most likely scenario that would mean it would chair the powerful budget committee and open the general debate during budget consultation giving prominence to it alternative to government policy georg pazderski a member of the afd s executive board told reuters his party would use parliamentary speech to draw attention to the cost of the migrant crisis trouble in the euro zone  which the afd want germany to leave  and problem related to the european union we ll have a voice when we re in parliament he said we won t be an easy opposition he expects other party will shun the afd for a year or two but ultimately work with it pointing to the regional assembly in the eastern state of saxonyanhalt where the afd and merkel s christian democrat voted to set up a committee to investigate leftwing extremism gauland told reuters the afd would call for a committee to investigate the chancellor after entering parliament we want m merkel s policy of bringing million people into this country to be investigated and we want her to be severely punished for that for an interactive

bjoern hoecke s wing and who really represents nazi view into any position of responsibility hoecke ha denied that adolf hitler wa absolutely evil described berlin s holocaust memorial a a monument of shame and demanded a degree turnaround in the way germany seek to atone for nazi crime the justice minister said some of the afd s program like it demand to ban minaret is unconstitutional alexander hensel who studied the afd s role in regional parliament for the otto brenner foundation said debate in state assembly had become more polarized since the afd arrived and some other mp would not shake hand with the newcomer the afd s aggressive rightwing position have intensified the debate while the tone and way people deal with each other in parliament ha become noticeably rougher due to the afd s tough rhetoric and targeted provocation he said unlike previous rightwing movement in germany the afd  founded in by an antieuro group of academic  ha become socially acceptable so radicalized people from the middle class feel able to vote for it alongside classic radical rightwing voter said manfred guellner head of forsa polling institute you don t vote for skinhead but you can vote for professor in suit said guellner referring to the like of gauland who tends to wear tweed jacket the afd is unlikely to gain much more support though said jackson janes president of the american

politics but absurdly cruelif enacted donald trump s platform would endanger our security both at home and abroad domestically his protectionist trade policy and draconian immigration restriction would enlarge our federal deficit raise price for consumer and throw our economy back into recession trump s global outlook steeped in isolationism is considerably outofstep with the traditional republican stance a well the flippancy with which he is willing to abdicate the united state responsibility to lead is alarming calling for the u withdrawal from nato and actively endorsing nuclear proliferation donald trump s foreign policy would wreak havoc on the established world order which ha held aggressive foreign power in check since world war iiperhaps most importantly however donald trump simply doe not possess the temperament and character necessary to lead the united state through an increasingly perilous world the last week should have made obvious to all what ha been obvious to most for more than a year in response to any slight perceived or real donald trump lash out viciously and irresponsibly in trump s eye disagreement with his action or his policy warrant incessant name calling and derision stupid lying fat ugly weak failing idiot and that s just his fellow republicanshe isn t eschewing political correctness he is eschewing basic human decencydonald trump despite spending more than a year on the campaign trail ha either refused or been unable to educate himself on issue that matter most to american like u he speaks only in platitude about greatness success and winning time and time again trump ha demonstrated his complete lack of knowledge on critical matter meandering from position to position over the course of the election when confronted about these frequent reversal trump lie in a manner more brazen and shameless than anything politics ha ever seenmillions of people across the country are feeling despondent their hour have been cut

and flirtation with fascism are unparalleled in the history of our democracy he hope to divide u by race by class and by religion instilling enough fear and anxiety to propel himself to the white house he is looking to to pit neighbor against neighbor friend against friend american against american we will not stand for this vitriolic rhetoric that is poisoning our country and our childrenpresident reagan called on u to maintain this our shining city on a hill he called on u to maintain freedom abroad by keeping a strong presence in the world he called on u to maintain liberty at home by upholding the democratic process and respecting our opponent he called on u to maintain decency in our heart by loving our neighborhe would be ashamed of donald trump we are toothis fall we will instead focus our effort on reclaiming the republican party from those who have done it considerable harm campaigning for candidate who will uphold the conservative principle that have defined the republican party for generation we will work to ensure both chamber of congress remain in republican hand continuing to protect against executive overreach regardless of who win the election this novemberwe call on our party s elected leader to renounce their support of donald trump and urge our fellow college republican to join u in condemning and withholding their endorsement from this

sticking out into the air thanksgiving at angkor royal cafe a flier read and rd november join u for a traditional thanksgiving feast this wa at one of the international hotel in siem reap a cambodian city near the world architectural treasure of angkor wat and the ancient khmer capital angkor thomthe same day i read an email sent to me from the united state by my native american friend with a link to an essay published by mpn news called thanksgiving guide how to celebrate a sordid history it began with a summary while million of american prepare this week to get into the holiday spirit beginning with thanksgiving how many are prepared to view the day through an accurate lens while to many american the holiday serf a a reminder to give thanks it is seen a a day of mourning by countless of others the truth is european migrant brutally murdered native american stole their land and continue to do so today the day became an official day of festivity in to celebrate the massacre of over people from the pequot tribein a hotel i approached a cheerful french food and beverage manager and asked him whether he wa aware of what he wa suggesting should be celebrated in one of his restaurant oh i know i know he replied laughing it is a little bit controversial isn t it bit controversial i wondered it appears more like you are inviting people to celebrate genocide a holocaust with free flowing wine and a giant turkey i am trying to see thing positively he continued grinning at me then he summarized so i guess you won t be joining u tonight what a pity what a pity i thought what a pity i won t get to eat that famous american pie tonight and turkey and who know what else just because i am not eager at all to celebrate the massacre and land grab perpetrated by the empirethe manager couldn t help asking where are you from i knew he would ask no european would say what i wa saying i m russian i replied oh i see he gave me that i should have guessed smile russianamerican i addedi m convinced that the french manager ha been sincerely oblivious about what i wa stating he is supposed to be oblivious there are after all our genocide and the genocide of the others our genocide those that we triggered or committed should never be discussed or more precisely it is extremely impolite to discus them most of the people don t even know about them including many of the victim on the other hand the genocide committed by the others particularly by adversary of the west are widely discussed publicized analyzed inflated and very often even fabricated all this described in detail in my page book exposing lie of the empire cambodia is the textbook case of the latter here several decade ago the u and it ally first supported the hopelessly corrupt and brutal government in phnom penh while triggering a monstrous carpetbombing campaign of the cambodian countryside mainly near the border with vietnam this wa supposed to prevent the country from going communist or at least ho chi minh style communist hundred of thousand of villager were murdered by the bombing million were forced to hit the road leaving their dwelling a the countryside wa converted into a giant minefield covered by unexploded ordnancefurther hundred of thousand died from starvation and disease furious mad from suffering the people of cambodia rose against the collaborator with the west in phnom penh pol pot and his khmer rouge took the capital virtually unopposed recently deep in the jungle i spoke to the former pol pot s personal guard i asked them pointblank whether they knew anything about communism nothing at all i wa told the u wa murdering our family for no reason corrupt elite were selling the country to the west we were all outraged and ready for revenge we would follow anybody calling for revenge however the west is passing the event to this day a a communist genocide rwanda is yet another case of a twisted narrative i made an entire fulllength documentary film rwanda gambit on the subject there the west turned the history upside down reducing the entire tragedy into a primitive and easytodigest narrative of bad hutu killing good tutsi yet even the former u ambassador robert flatten told me that his country groomed armed and supported the deadly rpf mainly tutsi army which had been before raiding the rwandan countryside from neighboring uganda burning village and killing civilianswhile a former australian lawyer and un investigator michael hourigan supplied me with information about the downing of the plane which in april killed both the rwandan president juvenal habyarimana and burundian president cyprien ntaryamira while on the final approach to kigali airport the order to shoot down the plane were given by the rpf leader paul kagame who wa in turn sponsored by the west this event triggered the terrible bloodletting on the next year in the rwandan army entered the democratic republic of congo drc and participated in the killing of at least million people mainly civilian on behalf of western government and multinational company making it the worst crime against humanity in recent historyin fact almost all the major genocide committed by the west or it ally in modern history are silent one including those in iraq syria iran west papua east timor drc indonesia afghanistan angola and dozen of other unfortunate place all over the worldthe gruesome genocide committed by the west all over the world during the last but especially during the last year are never defined a such never a genocide throughout history european country have been destroying systematically most of the culture on all continent of the planet enslaving virtually all the nonwhite nation plundering and looting it colony read almost all the nonwhite nation of the world while exterminating hundred of million of men woman and child the death toll ha been rising accumulating to near billion according to the testimony of one of my friend a senior un statisticiani will return to the cambodian story soon on the page of this magazine and i will be returning again and again to the genocide committed by europe and north america virtually everywhere unless the history is understood and acknowledged the world ha no future and there can be no solution to the terrible problem that our humanity is facingbut for now let me conclude this brief essay by saying that i did not participate in the consumption of turkey and american pie on thanksgiving holiday in the cambodian city of seam reapmy thought went to those people from the pequot tribe who rebelled stood firm and died for freedom almost year ago these were some of the first fighter against western imperialism these were the american that i admire this is america that had been terribly damaged but not yet completely destroyed no overly sugary sentimental and empty word could fully choke it essence a no gluttony and food orgy could ever fully silence the scream of the pain

reuters  conservative u supreme court justice on tuesday expressed skepticism about reviving a lawsuit filed by the family of a mexican teenager against a u border patrol agent who fatally shot the yearold from across the border in texas in among the concern raised by justice wa whether nonus citizen injured by drone attack overseas that are directed from the united state could file similar claim if the lawsuit wa allowed to move forward in a closely watched case that could affect u immigration action under president donald trumps administration the courts liberal justice expressed sympathy toward allowing the case to move forward indicating the justice could be headed toward a  split such a ruling would leave in place a lower courts decision to throw out the civil right claim against the agent jesus mesa filed by the family of sergio hernandez the supreme court potentially could delay action on the case to see if trumps nominee to fill a vacancy on the court conservative appeal court judge neil gorsuch is confirmed by the u senate gorsuch could then potentially cast the deciding vote a ruling would normally be due by the end of june justice anthony kennedy a conservative who sometimes side with the liberal justice in close case and whose vote could be pivotal in this one voiced doubt about the familys argument during the courts hourlong argument kennedy indicated the question of how to compensate victim of crossborder shooting is one that the u and mexican government should resolve youve indicated that theres a problem all along the border why doesnt that counsel u that this is one of the most sensitive area of foreign affair where the political branch should discus with mexico what the solution ought to be kennedy asked the hernandez familys lawyer robert hilliard chief justice john robert another conservative brought up the sensitive question of whether u official could be sued for drone attack overseas how do you analyze the case of a drone strike in iraq where the plane is piloted from nevada why wouldnt the same analysis apply in that case he asked hilliard the justice heard the case at a time that the security of the lengthy usmexico border is a hot topic with president donald trump moving forward with plan for a border wall he said is needed to combat illegal immigration the case is one of three the justice currently are considering that concern the extent to which the u constitution provides right to nonus citizen that issue ha become more pressing in light of trumps january order put on hold by the court to block entry into the united state by people from seven muslimmajority country and refugee trump is preparing a rewritten version of the ban the case raise several legal question including whether or not the u constitutions ban on unjustified deadly force applied to hernandez because he wa a mexican citizen on mexican soil when the shooting occurred in june the court could resolve the case by simply deciding not to apply a supreme court ruling in a case involving federal drug enforcement agent that allowed such lawsuit in limited circumstance the court ha been reluctant in subsequent case to extend that ruling to other type of conduct kennedy seemed unwilling to take that step saying the hernandez shooting would be an extraordinary case in which to allow a lawsuit against a federal official liberal justice appeared more willing to examine whether some u right extend to border area where the u government exercise a certain amount of authority even beyond the border line a it doe in the culvert where hernandez wa killed justice elena kagan said it could be described a a nomans land that is neither one thing or another thing likewise justice stephen breyer said the border area could be viewed a a special kind of physical place where u law could extend in certain instance hernandezs lawyer cited a report by the washington monthly magazine that said over a five year period border agent were involved in crossborder shooting killing six mexican national justice sonia sotomayor another liberal said that in order to deter such shooting why should there not be a civil remedy to ensure that border police are complying with the constitution the incident took place at a border crossing between el paso texas and ciudad juarez mexico the u border patrol said at the time that hernandez wa pelting u agent with rock from the mexican side of the rio grande before the shooting u authority have asserted that mesa shot hernandez in selfdefense lawyer for hernandezs family

sometimes it take a wolf to catch a snakerudy giuliani ha been making the medium round over the last two day bragging that he knew about fbi director james comey s letter two day before it went publicthat mean giuliani ha been getting inside information from the supposedly nonpartisan federal bureau of investigation that he ha likely been passing on to donald trump which mean the fbi appears to be colluding with trump s campaign to sabotage hillary clintonand during an interview with wolf blitzer on cnn friday night giuliani wa cornered over it because the only way he could possibly get such information is if a current fbi agent is passing information to him personally or through someone else no i ve spoken to no current fbi agent giuliani claimed when asked by blitzer gosh in the last eight month nine month ten month certainly not about this then giuliani claimed that everything he ha been hearing is just hearsay but that apparently ha not stopped him from spewing the hearsay on fox news and elsewhere in an effort to smear hillary clinton so i ve had lot of conversation with them and they have told me a lot about the i guess the disagreement between the justice department on the one hand and the fbi on the other but it all come from former fbi agent and it s all hearsay but that s hard to believe since giuliani claimed that he knew about comey s letter two day in advance and that letter wa actually released it wa not hearsayblitzer then hit giuliani with a statement written by democratic congressman accusing him of obtaining leaked information from fbi agentsthe statement read this morning rudy giuliani one of donald trump s closest and most vocal campaign adviser appeared on national television and confirmed that he had obtained leaked information about the fbi s review of clintonrelated email several day before fbi director james comey sent his letter to congress last friday about this letter in fact mr giuliani went even further and bragged about the information that he had obtained stating did i hear about it you re darn right i heard about it again the only way giuliani could have heard about this is if a current fbi agent leaked the information to him or passed it to him through someone else either way the fbi ha a serious breach that is being used to help donald trump that s not correct giuliani responded i ve had no conversation with anyone inside the fbi i have heard for the last four month a tremendous amount of information about the consternation within the fbi the fact that fbi agent were very unhappy about the way they were being treated by the justice department but none of it came from any current i haven t talked to a current fbi agent so giuliani just admitted that he is getting this information from former agent who are getting the information from current agentsblitzer actually got giuliani to claim that he didn t know that comey wa going to release the information he did and that it came a a surprise but giuliani did an aboutface only second later and said it wasn t a surprise seriously blitzer did a great job of getting giuliani to tie himself in knotsthe former nyc mayor then repeated his alleged hearsay once again by claiming that he ha heard from his source that fbi agent are angry at the justice department for not indicting hillary clinton despite the fact that director comey recommended that charge were not warrantedgiuliani then claimed that he read article about it somewhere but didn t specify where the article came from and said he s not sure if they are trueso giuliani claim that he is talking to former fbi agent and that what he ha heard is merely hearsay that he spread anyway a if it s the truth and then he claim that he read this information in article even though he doesn t know if what he is reading is the truth and he still repeat it to anyone within earshotand wolf blitzer drove a stake through the heart of giuliani s bullshit by asking one question but let me ask you a question mayor if you don t know it s true why are you suggesting it why are you going on national television talking about these issue if you don t know it s true giuliani once again touted his fbi source only to then be informed by blitzer that fbi agent sign a form agreeing to never reveal information about investigation and that they have a responsibility to not leak information to people like giulianihere s the video via youtubeadmedia campaign the fbi should be thoroughly investigated by the justice department to find out who is leaking information to a private citizen who also happens to be a surrogate for a presidential candidate who will do anything to smear his opponent in an effort to win the election this is a major breach within the fbi and it definitely look like the fbi is working with republican to persecute hillary clinton people need to be fired for this and the first person to lose their job should be director comeyfeatured image via

political price to pay for all of this not only are blacklivesmatter on the rampage over these latest shooting event but also legrier s mother janet cooksey appeared on national tv last sunday at a news conference wearing a tshirt emblazoned with the face of mayor emanuel with the word rahm failed u throughout the debacle emmanuel ha not given in to the public pressure even though his approval rating ha plummeted since hostility began on top of this chicago ha earned the reputation of murder capital of america despite the mayor s staunch liberal policy of gunfree zone across the city which some critic credit towards creating a criminal s paradise the mayor is already on shaky ground only last winter emanuel narrowly survived a close runoff election to keep his job in officeall of this ha the potential to cast a shadow over emanuel s political future which is likely to include a democratic party presidential run in it s reported that emanuel already ha a substantial campaign war chest ready to go billion of dollar in fact thanks to some very wealthy backer if emanuel doe go ahead with the plan the driving force behind his campaign will be his hollywood mogul brother ari emanuel who will spare no expense in term of pr marketing and advertising for his brother s political drive to the white house part of the newly found emanuel family fortune derives from their early investment in the virtual taxi service sensation uber with the emanuel investment estimated to be valued over  billion alone this is not without controversy however a it wa mayor rahm emanuel s deregulation of chicago s taxi industry that helped uber share to skyrocket in value critic are saying that there wa a conflict of interest there but in today s seedy political environment of insider trading and open criminality it might be hard for any politician to pull rank over that issue add to this the potential hundred of million more in donation that emanuel will receive from jewish property tycoon sheldon adelson and also from jewish billionaire and emanuel s fellow antigun advocate michael bloomberg and all in the interest of serving israel and you can see how emanuel could be viewed a a democratic frontrunner alreadythe mayor emerged on to the dc sewer scene a part of the clintonobama chicago political machine he s been described by afp s victor thorn a more sinister than karl rove and potentially deadlier than dick darth vader cheney back when emanuel wa barack obama s chief of staff in many commentator remarked on his psychopathic behavior including his frightening

regardless that s a bit scary enough to scare the american people considering this is a man who most likely ha his eye on the white house dual loyalty rahm emanuel might have a hard to time putting u interest ahead of netanyahu sthe other strange bone of contention about emanuel a a candidate is that he is reportedly a dual citizen although it believed he gave up his israeli citizenship at year old who share a national identity between the united state and israel and actual served in the idf briefly after college according to mondoweiss emanuel left when the gulf war broke out in order to volunteer in the idf he served in one of israel s northern base until the war ended and upon his return to the u became clinton s advisor in the white house for almost eight year emanuel can often be seen in the presence of israel leader and zionist extremist bibi netanyahu which raise the real prospect of tel aviv finally having it very own u president embedded in the white housethe fundamental question here is when it come down to the crunch which country s interest would emanuel be more loyal towards the u or israel contrary to popular republican belief set you cannot wear allegiance to

international conflict a he vowed  or say he should get off of twitter those grumble are early warning sign for trump a he mark his th day in office on saturday they were heard in reuters interview with trump supporter in swing county that went for democrat barack obama in and but then flipped for trump last year  a slice of the electorate dominated by white voter that is crucial to the republicans reelection hope and that democrat want to win back reuters visited the same four place  pinellas county in florida northampton county in eastern pennsylvania macomb county outside of detroit michigan and gate county in rural north carolina  right after the nov election what reporter found this time in more than two dozen interview is that trump voter are largely standing with their man but with sign of restlessness mainly over foreign policy concern over getting legislation through congress and some skepticism that he wont be able to follow through with promise  from building a wall along the mexican border to repealing obamas signature healthcare law but rather than bash trump many largely blamed democrat and republican alike a fractured congress the federal judiciary and what they see a a hostile news medium they showed a willingness to trust the president almost implicitly saw him a a tireless worker and appreciated his effort to secure the border and curb immigration they had little interest in the infighting between his senior aide in the white house maybe sometimes i question whats going on said karen mayer an attorney in clearwater a west coast florida city in pinellas county where the majority of it voter went for obama in and but then flipped for trump last year he prevailed over democratic challenger hillary clinton by slightly more than percent of the vote there but at the same time i have faith that he ha a strong team mayer said in a statement touting trumps record in the first day the white house highlighted among other thing his attempt to streamline government by proposing a lean budget and his aggressiveness in foreign affair particularly with regard to challenging russia and iran if trump ha reason to worry about his reelection prospect it should be because of supporter like brian mccann who owns a real estate firm in northampton pennsylvania i think hes finding out that he cant follow through on all his talk he said internationally i think hes creating more tension than solutions that wa the main reason that holly peseski a legal assistant in mt clemens michigan graded trumps tenure a a bminus so far i dont like the recent bombing hes done peseski said referring to u missile strike on a syrian airfield and a huge bomb dropped on a militant hideout in afghanistan he wa a little too quick to act peseski had another complaint about trump i wish hed get off of twitter the county reuters visited reflect the rural suburban and largely white coalition that carried trump to the white house trump wa able to flip these county and dozen more like them powered by an enthusiastic voter base that included many people who had not cast ballot in year a well a some democrat who crossed over largely because of their dislike of clinton an analysis of reutersipsos polling data show slippage in trump approval rating with lower enthusiasm among white men without a college degree the core of his political base in comparing trumps approval rating in the first day of his tenure to a day period in april reuters also found a rise in disapproval among independent collegeeducated adult people with belowaverage income white woman and white millennials those woman voter were important to trumps victory he beat clinton percent to percent among white woman who comprise percent of the electorate in pinellas county for instance white woman are by far the largest demographic among it more than registered voter trump beat clinton there by a little more than vote david jolly a former republican congressman who lost his pinellasbased seat in november in part he said because of his criticism of trump ha seen few sign that the presidents support is fading but at the same time hes not picking up new supporters trumps overall approval rating in reutersipsos polling ha declined steadily over the past two week and is now at it lowest level since he took office with percent of american now approving of his performance in office some voter interviewed in the swing county identified the struggling effort to replace obamas healthcare law a an early worry about trump walter watson a retired art teacher in gatesville a town of about people in rural gate county north carolina said he did not like the way trump and republican tried to rush through a new healthcare plan without giving it what he thought wa proper consideration you got to be careful because this is a life and death issue for a lot of people watson said his sparsely populated county backed obama with percent of the vote in but trump won it with percent in congress is the biggest hindrance to trumps success many of those interviewed said i dont think hes going to be able to do even half of what he claimed said bob white a retired finance worker in clinton township in michigan i dont think congress is going to go along with him but even a they express skepticism that trump can achieve all of his campaign promise his supporter are sticking with him for now i think hes trying said watson but he probably overstated what he could do because even a president ha

st century wire say here s something quite pavlovian to think about what if it were a goal of government and their security service to ensure that we feel we re being watched at every turn in everyway feasible but reality is not exact what we think it is and we re doing most of the censoring all by ourselvesadam garrie from the duran take u on an interesting journey in the below article it also contains an important element of what we ve talked about on show at st century wire and alternate current radio s the boiler room regarding this fourth wall that people find it difficult to push through which is fear the fear of losing their job loved one social acceptability and so forthmore on this article from the duran adam garrie the duraneven prior to the release of vault from wikileaks people knew that socalled intelligence agency in western state had the mean to spy on their own citizen many also assumed that the typical illegality of such activity wa of no consequence for agency and individual in those agency who regard themselves a being above the lawnow that we know the cia and other institution have such ability to digitally hack just about every household device from the smart phone and smarttv to the good old fashioned pc the biggest question is when do these deep state organisation implement these measure to spy on civilian and compromise their livesthe answer can be found without needing to resort to conspiracy theory nor even speculation the answer lie in the private sectororganisations like the cia mi fbi etc need only do what the private sector isn t all ready doing for them and a it is the private sector is doing a hell of a lotif one wonder why major financial academic diplomatic trading banking security and even artistic institution in the west tend to have people on their payroll who follow the western ideological narrative there are two reasonsthe first is that people are attracted to likeminded people and by extrapolation likeminded professionsbut there is a second more devious reason those who think outside the western box those who question more simply cannot get a foot through the door technically one needn t have any view on vladimir putin to be on the board of a major western construction company law firm private bank or hedge fund these profession do not involve knowledge of russian politics or society but those who have and even casually express a view of putin or of the arab world or of east asia and latin america that differs from the neolibneocon point of view are blacklistedsocial medium ha made this blacklisting easier to do than ever if two equally qualified candidate were applying for a high level position at a financial institution and one person had a picture of himself at a hillary clinton fundraiser on his facebook and the other had a save palestine picture or a proputin meme on his social medium account there would be no prize for correctly guessing who would almost certainly get the jobin the word of george carlin it s a big club and you ain t in it the punitive blacklisting of those who don t follow the cnnbbcnyt script ha a double effectfirst of all it keep those who think outside the box away from position of power in the private sector and in most western country without a prominent position in the business or mainstream entertainment community achieving political office is next to impossiblesecondly there is a powerful deterrent effect many people would like to post proputin prodonbass prosyria or propalestine item on social medium but they are afraid that it could cost them their job their bonus or even their friend in the west such thing can breakup family it happens every day at this very movement someone in a western country is contemplating suicide because of being on the losing end of a divorce settlement very sad yet very truethis kafkaesque reality is achieved without the cia needing to hack people s phone or computer the private sector doe the job for themfor every tabloid story about a woman losing her job because she posted a photo of her genitals online there are many more people who are professionally compromised for posting photo of patriotic russian or arab leadersthroughout the th century the private sector ha always been happy to do the bidding of the deep state hollywood wa largely compliant with the red scare tactic of the s and frankly hollywood producer did more to censor freespeech than the drunk and soon discredited joseph mccarthy ever could have donewhy should the cia waste time and money to read people s email when their much more local bos or chairman of human relation can take a quick look at facebook and achieve the cia s goal far more easilythe answer is that they don t the beauty of a police state is that unquestioning citizen are deputy of the secret police and they work for free some do it willfully and others do it unconsciously but they do it nevertheless continue this article at the

opposition to what she called the ground zero mega mosque near the site of the destroyed world trade center her most recent controversy wa the organization of a draw the prophet muhammad contest in texasat the event two selfdescribed jihadist shot a security guard before police killed them then on june police killed a knifewielding muslim man in boston whose goal wa allegedly to behead geller in retaliation for the contest even though the contest wa a major news story few medium outlet published the winning cartoon geller s group american freedom defense initiative put the image on billboard of which debuted in st louis on monday with the tagline support free speech she spoke to the hollywood reporter about how the largely hostile medium is portraying these eventswhy are you being overly provocative purposely insulting muslimsi am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting muslim islamic jihadist not i made muhammad cartoon the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them if we don t stand against them on that point the only alternative is surrender and submission i did not make the cartoon a flash point the jihadis didbut if you just don t insult their prophet they ll leave you alone nono the death penalty for insulting muhammad is just one aspect of sharia there is much much more of infidel behavior that violates sharia if we refrain from drawing muhammad more demand to adhere to other aspect of sharia will follow million are suffering or have been slaughtered under islamic sharia law in muslim country islamic supremacist mean to impose it in the westthere is no hate speech exception to the first amendment hate speech is a subjective judgment if it were outlawed the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate if a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence that group will rule unopposed while everyone else life in fear while other group curtail their activity to appease the violent group this result in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others cartoon have been used a satire since the beginning of satire especially in our country and no one get a pas not the pope of rome president of the united state or hollywood s biggest movie star if you don t like it don t look at it boycott the network that air it don t buy the publication make counterimages make a million fine but you have to adjust to u not we to you and if that s too much don t come here threaten violence commit violence the consequence are yours to bearit seems many medium pundit who claim allegiance to the first amendment aren t persuaded by your argumentsthey are afraid of being killed by islamic jihadist and camouflage their fear and cowardice a respect for islam and muslimsare there any tv host who have been particularly hostile to you during interviewsyes martha maccallum erin burnett alisyn camerota chris cuomo although he let me speak and make my casehow about behind your backyes bill o reilly and laura ingraham they said i wa insulting the entire religion one held by our moderate ally such a egypt and qatar they are wrong in assuming that we must submit to sharia to placate moderate rather than that moderate need to accept the freedom of speech roman catholic don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religion but roman catholic don t kill when their religion is mocked and so no one talk about provoking them or respecting them in any pluralistic society we have to put up with being offended and even with our core belief being mocked roman catholic have learned that mormon and others have learned that look at the book of mormon on broadway why must we condescend to muslim and think they cannot learn that it s the low expectation of soft bigotryso this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservative stand by you and liberal don tno chris hayes stuck up for me on msnbc this is not a leftright split it is a free personslave splitdid any tv host say something that struck you a particularly wrongheadedthey all say i have the right to draw muhammad but shouldn t out of respect they don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadist a a victory and embolden them to make more demand cnn s erin burnett said i relished being the target of a beheading it s madness who selfpromotes to get killedso you re not purposely courting danger a burnett and others have insinuatedof course not i love life but i will not live a a slaveare there any tv host you d like to face off with but who won t have you onbill o reilly i expect he know he would be shown upwe know about the man arrested who intended to behead you any other threat you can sharei have received many threat the fbi and nypd are aware of them and on the caseanyone in hollywood reach out to you to offer supportnoshould hollywood care about threat against youthey may think they re exempt but they aren t islamic supremacist will be demanding they adhere to sharia a well of course most producer already are careful not to show anything that might offend muslim including accurate representation of jihad plotting and activity so hollywood is mostly already in their pocket but this is their issue and the entertainment industry should be on the front line in the information battle space the jihadist aren t just coming for me they are coming for all of u that believe in freedomso why do you think hollywood which routinely claim to push the envelope in it art hasn t supported youthey re afraid of being ostracizedyour draw muhammad event certainly got a lot of news coverage should mainstream medium outlet have published the winning cartoonevery medium outlet should publish the muhammad cartoon they can t kill u all by kowtowing to violent intimidation they are inviting more of it instead they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech if the medium had published the danish cartoon back in this would never have become an issue the submission by medium entertainment and academic elite empowered the savagesthe southern poverty law center included you on their list of hate group are they rightof course not they re the hate group using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hardleft agenda the splc smear machine doe not profile jihad group but they target and libel patriot veteran tea party organization and other group that work in defense of freedom they named republican presidential contender

north charleston sc reuters  republican presidential frontrunner donald trump and top challenger ted cruz ended a longstanding truce in spectacular fashion on thursday night with bitter exchange during what may have been trumps strongest debate performance to date the new york billionaire and the texas senator appeared to have a split decision by the end of the night a sign that for all the bluster little took place that could derail trump from his lead position with a contest in iowa on feb to begin the search for a republican presidential nominee projection that the debate would be a freeforall were accurate beyond the trumpcruz theatrics u senator marco rubio of florida turned in a pugnacious performance with attack on cruz and new jersey governor chris christie florida governor jeb bush presented himself a a voice of reason against trump a google snap poll showed viewer believed trump who in the most recent debate wa at time less engaged won the night with percent to cruzs percent and rubios percent until the fox business network debate in north charleston south carolina trump and cruz had been friendly because they have both been chasing conservative of the tea party movement and did not want to anger them with trump now needing to fend off cruzs rise in iowa he pushed his charge that cruz may not be constitutionally qualified to serve a president because he wa born in canada the u constitution say only natural born citizen can become president of the united state who the hell know if you can even serve in office trump told cruz drawing a scattering of boo in the audience born in calgary alberta to a u citizen mother and a cuban father cruz accused trump of bringing up his birthplace simply because cruz wa leading some poll in iowa cruz said trump who led the movement questioning whether the hawaiianborn president barack obama wa really from the united state had asked his lawyer to look into the issue of cruzs birth in september and concluded there were no issue since september the constitution hasnt changed but the poll number have cruz said and i recognize that donald is dismayed that his poll number are dropping in iowa but the fact and the law here are really clear trump said democrat would sue if cruz were on the republican ticket putting their partys chance of winning at risk cruz shot back that he had spent many year studying constitutional law im not going to be taking legal advice from donald trump the birthright issue ha dogged american politics before republican nominee john mccain survived question about his birth in panama because he wa born on a u military installation there and it wa judged to be u soil in republican candidate george romney faced question about his birth in mexico but his candidacy never advanced far and the issue wa abandoned while cruz seemed to have parried the attack for now he wa stung by trump on another issue whether people who live in new york city have the same value a other american cruz ha lately begun denouncing new york values to connect trump to the citys famous liberalism everyone understands that the value of new york city are socially liberal are proabortion are progay marriage cruz said trump in perhaps his most heartfelt remark of the night harked back to new yorks response to the sept attack to defend his home city the people in new york fought and fought and fought and we saw more death and even the smell of death and it wa with u for month the smell the air and we rebuilt downtown manhattan and everybody in the world watched and everybody in the world loved new york and loved new yorkers and i have to tell you that wa a very insulting statement that ted made trump said rubio in third place behind trump and cruz in iowa and hoping a strong outcome there will help him in the new hampshire primary on feb frequently inserted himself into argument and tried to put pressure on cruz he accused cruz of proposing a value added tax a part of his tax plan and of being soft on immigration that is not consistent conservatism he said that is political calculation he attacked christie a well accusing him of have liberal position on education policy and abortion christie interrupted a rubiocruz exchange with this blast id like to interrupt this debate on the floor of the senate you had your chance marco you blew it he said cruz who ha taken the lead in some poll of iowa republican voter did well on social medium social medium monitoring tool zoomph saw total positive mention for cruz climb by more than percent while he sparred with

paris reuters  president donald trump s hawkish new approach towards tehran coupled with banking worry and domestic political turbulence in both country are causing growing uncertainty over iran s  billion deal to buy airliner from boeing airbus and atr iranair s decision to buy a total of aircraft from the two giant and francoitalian turboprop maker atr marked the zenith of a pact between tehran and world power to renew trade in exchange for placing curb on iran s nuclear activity iranair say it  billion deal with boeing is the biggest with a u company since the islamic revolution such high stake make the deal a prominent target for critic of detente in both washington and tehran and expert say that could further frighten off european bank and others whose reluctance to provide finance is already a major obstacle trump struck a blow against the nuclear agreement with iran on friday choosing not to certify that tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it his iran strategy angered tehran and put washington at odds with other signatory of the accord  britain france germany russia china and the european union  some of which have benefited economically from renewed trade with iran while trump did not pull the united state out of the agreement he gave the u congress day to decide whether to reimpose economic sanction on tehran that were lifted under the pact even without such sanction the fate of the aircraft deal depends on u administration approval several people involved in the airliner deal fear they have become too big to cancel but too sensitive to implement fully beyond a limited number of jet for which iran ha the fund to pay for in cash without foreign loan i don t see who would be willing to provide financing for iran with such a negative groundswell in the united state said consultant and former aviation banker bertrand grabowski that raise immediate concern for boeing a it prepares to start building longrange twinengined er jet originally due for delivery to iran from next april the fate of those aircraft  part of a total order for jet  is seen affecting job a boeing try to put a floor under declining production of one of it most profitable model for the s it seems increasingly difficult now a western banker said unexpected hurdle have arisen on the iranian side too financial source say boeing ha already had to push iran back in the queue for jet because it ha yet to receive a deposit for now boeing can manage by juggling delivery with other airline but a complete breakdown of the iranair order could put new pressure on production u export are not the only one at stake although the european union back the nuclear deal the export of any western aircraft to iran depends on permit from the u administration because of the number of u part that mean airbus could get caught in the crossfire between boeing and congressional critic who want the whole deal axed something likely to deepen tension over iran with europe iran ha so far imported nine aircraft three from airbus and six from turboprop maker atr losing the rest of iran s business would hit airbus s order book hard because it took the risk of booking all iranian plane sale last december to help beat boeing in their annual order race boeing ha not yet formally posted it order because the airbus and boeing deal are so interconnected with approval passing through washington all eye are now on how trump s administration will treat the highprofile plane deal while kicking the broader nuclear issue to congress iran s foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said on saturday any negative move would be considered a violation of the nuclear pact between tehran and world power industry source say washington ha so far issued license for aircraft sale to iran until the end of the decade after which they must be renewed based on estimated delivery plan that effectively open the door to the boeing s and  airbus jet they said airbus and boeing declined to comment on delivery schedule one source said a possible outcome wa that the status quo would remain in place regarding license already issued because of the political and legal consequence of revoking them but that it would become harder to extend or obtain new one if so the fate of the second part of the iranair deal could be pushed beyond the next u election in even if the nuclear pact survives scrutiny in congress until then and other airline like aseman airline which ha ordered boeing jet and may want to buy turboprop face an uncertain wait for u approval a boeing spokesman said boeing and iranair continue to work on implementing the contract airbus declined to comment in tehran the aircraft deal remain centerstage a iranian hardliners seek to exploit the latest dispute with washington to weaken domestic rival who are open to the west for iran it is important that the deal remains intact the failure of the plane deal will be a major blow

core party principle that states right trump federal power and that program like obamacare represent a radical overreach by the federal government now a trump look to undo obamas legacy and begin constructing his own pruitt and other administration republican are showing little interest in protecting states right instead they are embracing sweeping new environmental healthcare and immigration policy that are to be imposed on all state at the same time democrat who over the last halfcentury have zealously defended sacrosanct federal law  such a the civil right act of that tackled segregation  against argument that state should be allowed to chart their own way are now making plan to employ some of those very states right position to fend off trump administration policy they disagree with if epa nominee pruitt is going to argue state can go their own way then certainly we should be allowed to make the exact same argument hawaii attorney general douglas chin a democrat who opposes pruitts nomination told reuters pruitts office did not return repeated request for comment sprawling flipflop the two parties switching of side is evident across a range of issue including socalled sanctuary city the environment and healthcare sanctuary city  an unofficial description of place where local law enforcement refuse to report undocumented immigrant to federal authority

lawyer planning to challenge that action told reuters they will base part of their legal argument on one successful approach pruitt and his fellow attorney general took against obamacare in the supreme court in in that case the court held that federal authority could not take away a states medicaid funding for refusing to expand the program although they won that part of the case pruitt and his group failed to stop the national rollout of obamacare immigration advocate hope the logic employed by the supreme court in that case will protect sanctuary city against threatened funding cut however ken cuccinelli the former republican attorney general of virginia who launched the legal challenge to obamacare told reuters he doubt court will apply that ruling to protect sanctuary city still cuccinelli said the new political dynamic will expose republican politician who ran for office on a states right platform because it fit their policy agenda rather than because they were true believer we may find out which folk were doing it for legal reason and purely political reasons he said another early battle highlighting the reversal of position on states versus federal right is likely to be the environment california a it governor made clear in a speech on tuesday will fight any attempt to rein in the states sweeping environmental law which go far beyond federal mandate during his confirmation hearing pruitt on the other hand refused to commit to keeping a decadesold federal waiver that allows california to set stricter emission standard the debate over how power should be shared between state and the federal government go back to the founding of the united state when federalist led by john adam and alexander hamilton argued for a strong central government while thomas jeffersons democraticrepublican party saw states right a a necessary check against tyranny jeffersons faction eventually morphed into the democratic party which backed states right to allow slavery leading up to the civil war of  the democrat moved toward greater reliance on federal power in the th century a they fought battle over civil right and regulating industry since then the two party have been fairly consistent in their stance though on some issue they have occasionally swapped position tension between states right and federal power played out time and again during

beijing reuters  president xi jinping s rule in china ha been marked by a muscular stance in many area from corruption to foreign policy  but investor and business leader hoping that the nation s most powerful leader in decade will drive market reform are girding for disappointment a he gear up for his second term hopedfor market liberalization is increasingly being viewed a secondary to xi s statecentered approach to economic policy and his focus on stability the communist party congress beginning on wednesday in beijing is expected to see xi consolidate his power and is unlikely to see a change in his priority party spokesman tuo zhen told reporter at a briefing on tuesday that china will persist with opening up and expanding market access but foreign executive and analyst question whether these kind of comment will mean a lot on the ground i don t see market opening coming it s all about discipline and control said one senior chinabased american executive who declined to be identified china s state council information office referred question on market reform to the country s economic planning agency the national development and reform commission which did not respond to a faxed request for comment some chinese policy insider said that they don t expect any significant speeding up we will not rush on reform the pace of change will not change dramatically said one advisor to the chinese government who wa speaking on condition of anonymity xi s sweeping anticorruption campaign and his move to personally take charge of economic policymaking had initially been seen by china analyst a early sign that he would use his consolidated power to push tough reform through entrenched bureaucracy the party s pledge under xi s thennew administration to let the market play a decisive role in the economy had also given hope to those pushing for reform but many analyst and business leader now see xi s faith in market a tenuous and that reform pledge a a mere holdover from his predecessor a lack of followthrough over the past several year on repeated state council vow to open market to the world have left foreign business with promise fatigue a the european union chamber of commerce in china put it last month those delay coincide with the passage of a raft of new national security and cyber security law and regulation that china s trading partner complain will put them at a disadvantage for the past or year it wa economic development at all cost and i think we are seeing a new paradigm now where national security is dominant and economic issue are channeled through that lens said jude blanchette who study the party at the conference board s china center for economics and business in beijing blanchette said true market reform in xi s second term would mean walking back much of the control he ha fought to acquire an unlikely prospect other painful reform that many economist say are needed have also moved slowly under xi they include overhauling china s debtladen state sector fixing the fiscal system to tackle local government debt bringing in new property tax to ward off housing bubble and allowing farmer to sell their land more freely capital control including restriction on some outbound investment deal have helped stabilize the yuan but at the cost of hampering china s ambition to internationalize the currency chinese reform advocate say the government ha been avoiding potentially disruptive change due to concern over economic and social stability and resistance from vested interest such a powerful staterun company if there are no such reform the conflict will keep accumulating while risk will be even higher which could destroy our prospect to move forward said jia kang director of the china academy of new supplyside economics a beijingbased think tank in xi espoused his own stateled supply side structural reform doctrine an effort in part to tame an explosion of debt by cutting capacity in heavy industry and reduce risk from bad bank loan while xi can tout continued robust economic growth  the government had set a gdp growth target of around percent but it now look like it will be closer to percent  it is still reliant on credit and investment a opposed to more sustainable consumption and expanded state control over the economy is at the center of key xi initiative including the made in china plan which funnel billion of dollar into robotics semiconductor and other industry deemed strategic despite government talk this year about opening some restricted sector to overseas investment some foreign business group express scepticism even a u president donald trump is expected to seek some concession for american business during his planned visit to beijing in early november until we see the equity cap lifted from percent to percent or higher with foreign bank or until we see foreign insurance company able to fully access the market we re just having the same conversation we had five year ago said jacob parker vice president of china operation at the uschina business council xi ha also reasserted that stateowned enterprise soes should be the commanding height of the economy foreign expert on chinese market point to government effort to merge state company into even larger champion a proof of how the state s vision of reform doe not necessarily mean increased use of free market in recent year beijing ha required state firm to reassert their communist party committee hold on corporate decisionmaking a blueprint for soe reform made no mention of the pledge for the decisive role of the market one senior western diplomat in beijing told reuters it ha become increasingly clear that the top priority for xi remains strengthening the primacy of the party and

type of covert globespanning force it own substantial fleet of hacker the agency s hacking division freed it from having to disclose it often controversial operation to the nsa it primary bureaucratic rival in order to draw on the nsa s hacking capacitiesby the end of the cia s hacking division which formally fall under the agency s center for cyber intelligence cci had over registered user and had produced more than a thousand hacking system trojan virus and other weaponized malware such is the scale of the cia s undertaking that by it hacker had utilized more code than that used to run

rival agency could be justifiedin a statement to wikileaks the source detail policy question that they say urgently need to be debated in public including whether the cia s hacking capability exceed it mandated power and the problem of public oversight of the agency the source wish to initiate a public debate about the security creation use proliferation and democratic control of cyberweaponsonce a single cyber weapon is loose it can spread around the world in second to be used by rival state cyber mafia and teenage hacker alikejulian assange wikileaks editor stated that there is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber weapon comparison can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such weapon which result from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value and the global arm trade but the significance of year zero go well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace the disclosure is also exceptional from a political legal and

global smart phone market in a specialized unit in the cia s mobile development branch produce malware to infest control and exfiltrate data from iphones and other apple product running io such a ipads cia s arsenal includes numerous local and remote zero day developed by cia or obtained from gchq nsa fbi or purchased from cyber arm contractor such a baitshop the disproportionate focus on io may be explained by the popularity of the iphone among social political diplomatic and business elitesa similar unit target google s android which is used to run the majority of the world s smart phone  including samsung htc and sony billion android powered phone were sold last year year zero show that a of the cia had weaponized android zero day which it ha developed itself and obtained from gchq nsa and cyber arm contractorsthese technique permit the cia to bypass the encryption of whatsapp signal telegram wiebo confide and cloackman by hacking the smart phone that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is appliedthe cia also run a very substantial effort to infect and control microsoft window user with it malware this includes multiple local and remote weaponized zero day air gap jumping virus such a hammer drill which infects software distributed on cddvds infectors for removable medium such a usbs system to hide data in image or in covert disk area brutal kangaroo and to keep it malware infestation goingmany of these infection effort are pulled together by the cia s automated implant branch aib which ha developed several attack system for automated infestation and control of cia malware such a assassin and medusa attack against internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the cia s network device branch ndbthe cia ha developed automated multiplatform malware attack and control system covering window mac o x solaris linux and more such a edb s hive and the related cutthroat and swindle tool which are described in the example section belowin the wake of edward snowden s leak about the nsa the u technology industry secured a commitment from the obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis rather than hoard serious vulnerability exploit bug or zero day to apple google microsoft and other usbased manufacturersserious vulnerability not disclosed to the manufacturer place huge swathe of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminal who independently discover or hear rumor of the vulnerability if the cia can discover such vulnerability so can othersthe u government s commitment to the vulnerability equity process came after significant lobbying by u technology company who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerability the government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerability discovered after on an ongoing basis year zero document show that the cia breached the obama administration s commitment many of the vulnerability used in the cia s cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agency or cyber criminalsas an example specific cia malware revealed in year zero is able to penetrate infest and control both the android phone and iphone software that run or ha run presidential twitter account the cia attack this software by using undisclosed security vulnerability zero day possessed by the cia but if the cia can hack these phone then so can everyone else who ha obtained or discovered the vulnerability a long a the cia keep these vulnerability concealed from apple and google who make the phone they will not be fixed and the phone will remain hackablethe same vulnerability exist for the population at large including the u cabinet congress top ceo system administrator security officer and engineer by hiding these security flaw from manufacturer like apple and google the cia ensures that it can hack everyone mdsh at the expense of leaving everyone hackablecyber weapon are not possible to keep under effective controlwhile nuclear proliferation ha been restrained by the enormous cost and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass cyber weapon once developed are very hard to retaincyber weapon are in fact just computer program which can be pirated like any other since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal costsecuring such weapon is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skill to exfiltrate copy without leaving trace sometimes by using the very same weapon against the organization that contain them there are substantial price incentive for government hacker and consultant to obtain copy since there is a global vulnerability market that will pay hundred of thousand to million of dollar for copy of such weapon similarly contractor and company who obtain such weapon sometimes use them for their own purpose obtaining advantage over their competitor in selling hacking servicesover the last three year the united state intelligence sector which consists of government agency such a the cia and nsa and their contractor such a booze allan hamilton ha been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by it own workersa number of intelligence community member not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigation in separate incidentsmost visibly on february a u federal grand jury indicted harold t martin iii with count of mishandling classified information the department of justice alleged that it seized some gigabyte of information from harold t martin iii that he had obtained from classified program at nsa and cia including the source code for numerous hacking toolsonce a single cyber weapon is loose it can spread around the world in second to be used by peer state cyber mafia and teenage hacker alikein addition to it operation in langley virginia the cia also us the u consulate in frankfurt a a covert base for it hacker covering europe the middle east and

proceduresonce in frankfurt cia hacker can travel without further border check to the european country that are part of the shengen open border area including france italy and switzerlanda number of the cia s electronic attack method are designed for physical proximity these attack method are able to penetrate high security network that are disconnected from the internet such a police record database in these case a cia officer agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instruction physically infiltrates the targeted workplace the attacker is provided with a usb containing malware developed for the cia for this purpose which is inserted into the targeted computer the attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable medium for example the cia attack system fine dining provides decoy application for cia spy to use to witness the spy appears to be running a program showing video eg vlc presenting slide prezi playing a computer game breakout or even running a fake virus scanner kaspersky mcafee sophos but while the decoy application is on the screen the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransackedin what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goal in living memory the cia structured it classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of vault the cia s weaponized malware implant  zero day listening post lp and command and control c system the agency ha little legal recoursethe cia made these system unclassifiedwhy the cia chose to make it cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concept developed for military use do not easily crossover to the battlefield of cyber war to attack it target the cia usually requires that it implant communicate with their control program over the internet if cia implant command control and listening post software were classified then cia officer could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rule that prohibit placing classified information onto the internet consequently the cia ha secretly made most of it cyber spyingwar code unclassified the u government is not able to assert copyright either due to restriction in the u constitution this mean that cyber arm manufacture and computer hacker can freely pirate these weapon if they are obtained the cia ha primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect it malware secretsconventional weapon such a missile may be fired at the enemy ie into an unsecured area proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including it classified part hence military personnel do not violate classification rule by firing ordnance with classified part ordnance will likely explode if it doe not that is not the operator s intentover the last decade u hacking operation have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into department of defense funding stream for instance attempted malware injection commercial jargon or implant drop nsa jargon are being called fire a if a weapon wa being fired however the analogy is questionableunlike bullet bomb or missile most cia malware is designed to live for day or even year after it ha reached it target cia malware doe not explode on impact but rather permanently infests it target in order to infect target s device copy of the malware must be placed on the target s device giving physical possession of the malware to the target to exfiltrate data back to the cia or to await further instruction the malware must communicate with cia command control c system placed on internet connected server but such server are typically not approved to hold classified information so cia command and control system are also made unclassifieda successful attack on a target s computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuver in a hostile takeover bid or the careful planting of rumor in order to gain control over an organization s leadership rather than the firing of a weapon system if there is a military analogy to be made the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuver against the target s territory including observation infiltration occupation and exploitationa series of

wikileaks year zero the cia s hand crafted hacking technique pose a problem for the agency each technique it ha created form a fingerprint that can be used by forensic investigator to attribute multiple different attack to the same entitythis is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victim the unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible a soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murder also find likely attributionthe cia s remote device branch s umbrage group collect and maintains a substantial library of attack technique stolen from malware produced in other state including the russian federationwith umbrage and related project the cia cannot only increase it total number of attack type but

questionnaire is used by the agency s osb operational support branch to transform the request of case officer into technical requirement for hacking attack typically exfiltrating information from computer system for specific operation the questionnaire allows the osb to identify how to adapt existing tool for the operation and communicate this to cia malware configuration staff the osb function a the interface between cia operational staff and the relevant technical support staffamong the list of possible target of the collection are asset liaison asset system administrator foreign information operation foreign intelligence agency and foreign government entity notably absent is any reference to extremist or transnational criminal the case officer is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer operating system used internet connectivity and installed antivirus utility psps a well a a list of file type to be exfiltrated like office document audio video image or custom file type the menu also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained this information is used by the cia s jqjimprovise software see below to configure a set of cia malware suited to the specific need of an operation improvise is a toolset for configuration postprocessing payload setup

berlin reuters  she ha earned a reputation a europe s chief crisis manager now germany s angela merkel must forge a government out of an awkward group of ally bent on nailing down a coalition deal so tight it risk limiting her room to act if crisis strike again the chancellor go into talk this week about forming a government but her task already tough after she lost ground in a sept national election is all the harder after defeat in a regional vote on sunday further weakened her hand the upshot is that she must draw on all her consensusbuilding skill to form a ruling alliance of her conservative the probusiness free democrat fdp and the green the term of a coalition deal should one be reached could determine merkel s room for maneuver on both the domestic and international stage during her year in power she ha been able to steer europe through it euro zone and refugee crisis in part due to her dominance at home any constraint on her ability to swiftly shape and enact policy could compromise germany s leadership role if the three party group fail to reach a deal at all some in their rank fear this could lead to public disenchantment and fuel further support for the farright alternative for germany afd which entered parliament for the first time last month the combination of the group going into coalition talk is untested at national level and merkel s wouldbe ally are not guaranteeing success the chancellor s christian democrat cdu and their bavarian ally meet the fdp and green separately on wednesday before they all meet on friday now we must gauge whether a platform for common policy can be found for me that is undecided fdp leader christian lindner told deutschlandfunk radio on tuesday adding to the complication the cdu fdp and green want to put any deal to their grassroots party member for approval fdp deputy leader wolfgang kubicki ha said it would be illusory to believe we could conclude negotiation by christmas one major area of contention is immigration policy the cdu and their conservative bavarian ally the christian social union csu have agreed a limit of a year on the number of migrant germany would accept on humanitarian ground but the other party reject a cap and instead favor an immigration law with criterion to attract highly educated worker to plug skill shortage they say the cducsu migrant agreement should not be baked into a coalition deal juergen trittin of the green said pressure on the conservative bloc to shift right  after bleeding support to the afd  could complicate the talk on forming a jamaica coalition socalled because the party color correspond with the jamaican flag i fear this will make the jamaica exploratory talk much more difficult trittin told the passauer neue presse the three party group also have deep difference on issue ranging from european union reform and tax to the environment a jamaica coalition wa formed in the tiny western german state of saarland in october but collapsed in january the same formation took power in the far northern region of schleswigholstein after election there in may this year annegret krampkarrenbauer the conservative state premier of saarland who led the former jamaica alliance there stressed the need to establish trust between the three national group it is important that there is a basic understanding among those people negotiating she added asked how to foster trust and understanding she replied talk talk talk but the size of the negotiating team  the cducsu and green have and people respectively  is undermining trust before the talk have even begun kubicki told focus magazine it wa a cardinal error to enter the discussion with such large team adding this wa not conducive to building trust and no basis for good and confidential negotiation the result of the mutual suspicion is that negotiator are pushing for deeper agreement in a coalition deal than in the page agreed by the outgoing grand coalition of merkel s conservative and the centerleft social democrat spd this risk limiting merkel s freedom in policymaking the euro zone and refugee crisis which were not foreseen in coalition agreement were addressed with ad hoc decision germany s budget surplus may help smooth the path in the coalition talk however it give scope to satisfy all side to some degree by paying for both tax cut and investment in area such a upgrading infrastructure for the digital age but if merkel is unable to form a threeway coalition with the fdp and green she could try to team up again with the spd  though the spd ha said it want to go into opposition should the spd reject her approach and merkel find herself unable to form a government she could try to form a minority government or else call fresh election  an unprecedented scenario if we don t get this under control the political system we ve had for year  and the stability it ha brought  will be threatened said one senior conservative

gaza reuters  mohammad dahlan who played a key backroom role in a major new effort for palestinian unity ha said a twostate peace agreement with israel wa impossible and healing wound from a civil war that split palestine wa now a priority once of the fiercest foe of hamas the islamist group that seized the gaza strip in a civil war in dahlan a member of the rival mainstream fatah party spoke to reuters after a unity cabinet held it first meeting in the enclave in three year the internal palestinian situation is more sacred is more important and is more useful now than the socalled negotiation the veteran politician said of talk with israel that collapsed in over issue such a israeli settlementbuilding in occupied territory and fatahhamas reconciliation a former peace negotiator with israel who speaks hebrew and who wa born in a refugee camp dahlan noted jewish settlement in the occupied west bank and east jerusalem area captured in a war and which palestinian seek along with gaza for a future state there is a complete judaisation of the west bank not only of jerusalem it ha become impossible for the twostate solution to be implemented therefore there is no political horizon he said in the rare interview israel ha built about settlement in the west bank about settler live there and a further in east jerusalem among about million palestinian fatah led by the secular heir of yasser arafat run the west bank head the internationally recognized palestinian authority and ha been responsible for negotiation with israel it rival hamas an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood drove fatah force loyal to president mahmoud abbas from gaza and ha run the tiny coastal strip that is home to two million people relation eased on monday when hamas handed over control of gaza to a unity government although it agreed to the deal three year ago the decision to implement it mark a striking reversal for hamas considered a terrorist group by israel the united state and most powerful arab country official on both side of the palestinian divide and in other arab country say dahlan based since in the united arab emirate wa behind an influx of cash to prop up gaza and a detente between hamas and arab state including egypt that led the group to dismantle it shadow government last month it wa an honor for u that we succeeded to have those understanding between hamas and egypt dahlan said by telephone from abu dhabi the former gaza security chief said he had kept silent during mediation effort but decided to speak out now that they have borne fruit dahlan said egypt which ha accused hamas of aiding an islamist insurgency in the sinai peninsula across the border from gaza held meeting with senior official of the group which denies aiding the militant both side agreed to shore up security along the border and prevent militant from crossing without reconciling with hamas and without hamas understanding the need of the egyptian national security there can be no serious palestinian reconciliation and no one but egypt is capable of playing an effective role dahlan said cairo will host hamas and fatah official next tuesday for further talk on powersharing and the holding of palestinian election longdelayed by the internal rift a first sign of discontent surfaced with hamas criticizing abbas s decision to await the outcome of the talk before lifting sanction he ha imposed on gaza in the interview dahlan called on hamas to show more patience because all the good thing are on the way thanks to egyptian mediation he dismissed any notion that egypt with the uae and saudi arabia wa pursuing palestinian reconciliation a part of any wider usinitiated push for a regional peace deal with israel the chance of the socalled deal of the century is zero because israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu doe not want peace and he imposed a reality of settler in the west bank and in jerusalem that made it impossible for the twostate solution to be implemented dahlan said netanyahu on tuesday warned palestinian against engaging in bogus reconciliation under which hamas kept it military arm in gaza which bristle with hundred of it rocket turning to palestinian politics dahlan who recently formed the fatah reformist and democratic party to challenge abbas  now in the th year of a fouryear term  accused him of committing crime and mistake but said he wa ready to reconcile with the yearold leader to reunite the fatah movement the ball is in his court and we are ready whenever he is said dahlan in exile since after quarrelling with abbas ambitious and charismatic he ha long been suspected of harboring design to succeed abbas dahlan said his strong tie with the uae helped him to raise hundred of million of dollar in aid for palestinian in gaza the west bank and east jerusalem in the past year a recent poll by the west bankbased palestinian center for policy and survey showed that those who still support fatah in gaza are shifting loyalty to dahlan his popularity among gazans ha risen over the past nine month from nine to percent dahlan said he wa not obsessed by opinion poll and a decision on whether he would run for a

almost like he s apologizing for appearing to be patriotic are you thinking what we re thinking he sang that song so many time but never felt ok singing it that s the difference between springsteen and someone like lee greenwood lee greenwood ha always been a passionate and fearless supporter of america and the american way springsteen is just a phony speaking at a qa session with tom hank at the tribeca film festival the yearold rocker opened up to the oscarwinning actor insisting that it wa e street band guitarist stevie van zandt who convinced him to keep the hitspringsteen s memorable tune wa written in part tribute to friend who had served in the american army during the vietnam war and the ironic treatment of the veteran upon their return home he divulged stevie van zandt longtime guitarist in the e street band convinced me to keep that song i remember at the time thinking it s too glib it s too glib i think i still think that but stevie said no no no it s about the band the brotherhood of the band the fan the new jersey native who ha been married to patti scialfa since added that he gave his musical peer the benefit of the doubt but still doesn t feel quite comfortable with the songadding i gave him the benefit of the doubt we ve played it an awful lot ever since but i wa always a little frightened of it and the whole record i always have mixed feeling about despite his feeling the epochal song ha received much praise throughout the year and wa ranked th on rolling stone s list of the greatest song of all time a well a placed on riaa s song of the centurythe fan favorite and title track of his album of the same name inspired famed photographer annie leibovitz s iconic photo of springsteen s backside against the backdrop of an american flag for

washington reuters  donald trump won the u presidency with less support from black and hispanic voter than any president in at least year a reuters review of polling data show highlighting deep national division that have fueled incident of racial and political confrontation trump wa elected with percent of the black vote percent of the hispanic vote and percent of the asianamerican vote according to the reutersipsos election day poll among black voter his showing wa comparable to the percent captured by george w bush in and ronald reagan in but bush and reagan both did far better with hispanic voter capturing percent and percent respectively according to exit polling data compiled by the nonpartisan roper center for public opinion research and trumps performance among asianamericans wa the worst of any winning presidential candidate since tracking of that demographic began in the racial polarization behind trumps victory ha helped set the stage for tension that have surfaced repeatedly since the election in white supremacist victory celebration in antitrump protest and civil right rally and in hundred of racist xenophobic and antisemitic hate crime documented by the southern poverty law center splc which track extremist movement the splc report there were incident of hateful harassment and intimidation between the day following the nov election and nov with a spike in such incident in the immediate wake of the vote sign point to an ongoing atmosphere of confrontation the loyal white knight of the ku klux klan a white separatist group that vilifies africanamerican jew and other minority plan an unusual dec rally in north carolina to celebrate trumps victory leftwing and anarchist group have called for organized protest to disrupt the presidentelects jan inauguration and a womens march on washington scheduled for the following day is expected to draw hundred of thousand to protest trumps presidency american politics became increasingly racialized through president barack obamas two term but there wa an attempt across the board across the party to keep those tension under the surface say jamila michener an assistant professor of government at cornell university trumps antiimmigrant antimuslim rhetoric brought those division to the fore it activated people on the right who felt empowered and it activated people on the left who saw it a a threat she added that dynamic wa evident last week when vice presidentelect mike penny attended the broadway musical hamilton in new york on friday the multiethnic cast closed with a statement expressing fear of a trump presidency a far different view wa on display the next day a a crowd of about people cheered trumps election at a washington conference of the national policy institute a white nationalist group with a strong antisemitic belief we willed donald trump into office we made this dream our reality npi president richard spencer said after outlining a vision of america a a white country designed for ourselves and our posterity he closed with hail trump hail our people hail victory though trumps election victory wa driven by white voter his performance even among that group wa not a strong a some of his predecessor reagan and george hw bush both won the presidency with higher share of the white vote than the percent that trump achieved the historical voting pattern reflect decade of polarization in american politics but the division surrounding trump appears more profound say ca mudde an associate professor specializing in political extremism at the university of georgia these day he add people say they dont want their child even to date someone from the other party indeed voters opinion of those on the opposite side of the partisan divide have reached historic low survey by the pew research center showed this year that majority of both party held very unfavorable view of the other party  a first since the center first measured such sentiment in and the lions share of those people believe the opposing partys policy are so misguided that they threaten the nations wellbeing the center found that level of division ha spurred activist on both side of the political divide to take their activism in a more confrontational direction in the wake of trumps victory protester on the left took to the street by the thousand in city across the country in some case causing property damage much of the agitation wa motivated by a belief that trumps administration will foster racism and push the court and other political institution to disenfranchise minority voter say james anderson editor of itsgoingdownorg an anarchist website that ha promoted mass demonstration against trumps presidency including a call to disrupt his inauguration many on the left have come to distrust government institution embracing a breed of activism aimed at directly confronting what they see a condemnable political force anderson say the answer now is to organize build power and autonomy and fight back on the opposite end of the political spectrum trumps election is bringing new hope for rightwing activist who felt abandoned by the major party john robert a top officer in the ku klux klan affiliate planning the december rally to celebrate trumps election say the group is committed to nonviolent demonstration but he see trumps election a likely to bring a new era of political conflict and much of the strife he say will be centered around racial division once trump officially take office there is going to be a boiling over

the stage for year of diplomatic tension between the united state and it southern neighbor mexico ha publicly protested u execution of it citizen over the year but interview with diplomat and review of official mexican government communiqués reveal that the turmoil caused by the medellin case ran deeper coming up at nearly every meeting between the united state and mexico and leading to an official protest to the united nation security council in given the level of frustration cruzs role in the court battle raise question about usmexico relation if he were to beat billionaire donald trump to the republican nomination and win the u presidential election in november i think relation would be complicated with a president cruz said sergio alcocer who wa mexicos deputy foreign minister responsible for north america between  alcocer praised cruz a intelligent and pragmatic but said the senator wa too inflexible on issue like immigration and the death penalty cruz take certain position that are very clearly defined and hes much more conservative much more dogmatic than trump alcocer said a cruz campaign official did not respond to request for comment in mexico city a foreign ministry spokesman said mexico had no preference among the u presidential candidate and would not comment on the election in the medellin case cruz defended the death sentence a texas court imposed on mexican citizen jose ernesto medellin after he wa convicted in for his role in the gang rape and strangling of two teenage girl in a houston park in the international court of justice of the united nation ruled that texas and other state had violated the vienna convention by failing to notify medellin and other mexican on death row of their right to contact the mexican consulate after arrest president george w bush ordered texas and other state to review the sentence cruz argued that while the united state had submitted to the international courts decision the white house could not implement an international agreement that required state to change their court procedure without action by congress the supreme court agreed in a  decision winning the case raised cruzs profile in conservative circle he ha recently said he would appoint justice who would narrowly interpret the constitution  a he did in the medellin case  a crucial talking point in the election following the death of supreme court conservative icon antonin scalia it wa an unusual thing at the time for the state of texas to be standing up against the president of the united state in front of the supreme court particularly when that president wa a texan and a republican and the former governor of this state cruz told cheering supporter at a houston rally in february one of the many time he ha brought up the case the supreme court ruling removed a potential legal barrier to three more execution of mexican national in texas who had been part of the same international court case a medellin even a u ally such a the european union and switzerland criticized what they saw a ongoing treaty violation mexico pressed u official and congress to follow the international courts directive and require state to review death sentence where people had been denied consular access the issue came up a one of the top few issue mexico raised in almost every bilateral meeting we had said harold hongju koh who wa legal adviser to the u state department from  alcocer the former mexican deputy foreign minister confirmed the issue of consular access wa raised during negotiation on other crossborder issue like the extradition of criminal its not resolved and its something that mexico need to keep insisting on he said in an interview mexican official said both the bush and obama administration had been open to working on the issue u state department official supported consularaccess legislation introduced in the senate but that wa not enough to spur congress to resolve the issue texas executed medellin in august five month after the supreme court decision drawing swift criticism from the united nation court three year later a texas prepared to execute another mexican national who had not received consular access mexicos thenambassador to the united state arturo sarukhan wrote to u secretary of state hillary clinton saying the action would seriously jeopardize cooperation on a range of issue it serf neither the united state nor the mexicous relationship if the u cannot live up to it treaty obligations said the letter which wa reviewed by reuters in mexico warned washington in another letter that the execution of mexican national who had been denied consular access would mean our whole forwardlooking bilateral engagement could be questioned a year later the government wrote to the president of the united nations security council expressing indignation over the execution of mexican citizen in violation of the international court directive sarukhan the former mexican ambassador said mexico had few option to put pressure on the united state without harming cooperation in other area march st mark now year since the decision wa rendered and the united state is yet to comply with it international obligations the government said in a statement responding to reuters question about the medellin case and cruzs involvement in it critic of the medellin ruling and cruzs boast about it say texas could have simply reviewed the sentence a the international court had asked texas could have provided that remedy time over in the time that it took to litigate that case up and down through the texas court and the supreme court said sandra babcock a law professor at cornell university who wa one of medellins attorney the longterm damage the reputational damage to the united state is still ongoing but cruzs supporter dismiss such criticism his job a solicitor general wa to defend texas not to worry about the international implication they say texas governor greg abbott a

washington reuters  donald trumps election a president raise the prospect the united state will pull out of the nuclear pact it signed last year with iran alienating washington from it ally and potentially freeing iran to act on it ambition outgoing president barack obamas administration touted the deal a legacy foreign policy achievement a a way to suspend tehrans suspected drive to develop atomic weapon in return obama a democrat agreed to a lifting of most sanction the deal harshly opposed by republican in congress wa reached a a political commitment rather than a treaty ratified by lawmaker making it vulnerable to a new u president such a trump who might disagree with it term a republican trump ran for the white house opposing the deal but contradictory statement made it unclear how he would act in an upset over democrat hillary clinton trump won on tuesday and will succeed obama on jan a businessmanturnedpolitician who ha never held public office trump called the nuclear pact a disaster and the worst deal ever negotiated during his campaign and said it could lead to a nuclear holocaust in a speech to the proisrael lobby group aipac in march trump declared that his numberone priority would be to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran he said he would have negotiated a better deal with longer restriction but somewhat paradoxically he criticized remaining u sanction that prevent american company from dealing with iran by contrast he ha conceded it would be hard to destroy a deal enshrined in a united nation resolution in august he said he would not rip up the nuclear deal but that he would police that contract so tough they dont have a chance iran denies ever having considered developing atomic weapon but expert said any u violation of the deal would allow iran also to pull back from it commitment to curb nuclear development those commitment include reducing the number of it centrifuge by twothirds capping it level of uranium enrichment well below the level needed for bombgrade material reducing it enriched uranium stockpile from around kg to kg for year and submitting to international inspection to verify it compliance say goodbye to the iran deal said richard nephew a former u negotiator with iran now at columbia university there is very little likelihood that it stay either because of a deliberate decision to tear it up by trump or step that the u take which prompt an iranian walk back the spokesman of the atomic energy organization of iran behrouz kamalvandi wa quoted a saying by tasnim news agency iran is prepared for any change adding that iran would try to stand by the deal the nuclear deal wa divisive in iran with hardliner opposed to better relation with the west arguing that pragmatist president hassan rouhani wa giving up too much of the countrys nuclear infrastructure for too little relief rouhani said on wednesday the u election result would have no effect on tehrans policy state news agency irna quoted him a saying nlndah some of washingtons closest middle east ally have been skeptical of the nuclear deal israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ha been outright hostile gulf leader say the deal ha emboldened irans pursuit of regional hegemony in part through support for proxy group fueling regional conflict iranian supreme leader ali khamenei whose power supersedes that of rouhani regularly criticizes the united state and say it should not be trusted but ultimately assented to the term of the deal known by it acronym jcpoa the big winner in the aftermath of a trump victory is irans supreme leader said suzanne maloney a foreign policy expert at the brookings institution he will have the most cartoonish american enemy he will exult in the hopefully brief crash of the american economy and he will be able to walk away from irans obligation under the jcpoa while pinning the responsibility on washington further complicating any trump effort to renegotiate the deal is that it is a multilateral agreement involving u ally in europe a well a fellow world power russia and china european and asian firm have been returning to iran and making major investment there meaning the united state would likely be alone in pulling out of the deal possibly isolating it from it partner on wednesday the head of gas renewables and power for french oil and gas company total totfpa in iran said trumps election would have no impact on investment npncw khamenei ha already promised to set fire to the nuclear deal if the west violates it iran ha repeatedly complained it ha not received benefit promised though european company have been eager to explore business prospect in iran few deal have been enacted in part because european bank have been reluctant to finance deal involving iran as to whether he can negotiate a better deal it take two or seven side to agree to begin that process something i rate a highly unlikely said zachary goldman executive director of the center on law and security at new york university and a former u treasury official and if we walk away from the deal i think we will be in the worst of all world  iran will feel freed from it commitment and we

antitrump besties matt damon and george clooney sat down with good morning america s michael strahan to discus their good friend democrat megadonor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator harvey weinstein not only did both actor who owe much of their successful career to harvey weinstein wait until their reputation were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator but they waited until only day before their new movie suburbicon is about to debut to say that they actually knew more about the abuse woman received at the hand of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted tonotably absent in the interview is the third actor ben affleck who completes the trio of bestie actor after affleck spoke out on the harvey weinstein controversy he wa also accused of covering up weinstein s behavior a well a video that show affleck used his power to prey on innocent woman notice how quickly damon throw affleck under the bus saying he knew but only told damon who of course never told anyone elseamericans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious holierthanthou liberal who have no value or moral yet try to shame american for supporting political candidate who don t hold the same liberal view a theirs are left with only one option boycottsuburbicon and boycotthollywood in the interview that aired on monday morning george clooney and matt damon said that they knew weinstein wa a bully and womanizer who bragged of bedding actress but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that wa occurring behind closed door in hotelsdamon also confessed that he wa aware weinstein had sexually harassed the first lady of miramax gwyneth paltrow just before the actress shot the film adaptation of jane austen s emma for the studio i knew the story about gwyneth from ben affleck because he wa with her after brad pitt and so i knew that story said damon but i wa working with gwyneth and with harvey on the film the talented mr ripley he then added i never talked to gwyneth about it but ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there wa an understanding and he treated her incredibly respectfully always affleck and pitt have not spoken about the incident and damon s revelation that he learned about weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problem for the embattled actor a it seems to contradict his initial statement i am saddened and angry that a man who i worked with used his position of power to intimidate sexually harass and manipulate many woman over decade said affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefullyworded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegationsdamon s decision to characterize the relationship between paltrow and weinstein a always respectful is a bit odd a well considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interviewclooney meanwhile said that like many of weinstein s victim he had been told a number of time by the mogul that he wa bedding a number of star harvey would talk to me about woman that he had had affair with said clooney i didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actress who were friend of mine and i didn t really think that they had affair with harvey and clearly they didn the then added but the idea that this predator this assaulter wa out there silencing woman like that it s beyond infuriating and the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it come out i want to know all of it daily mailwatch a these two actor desperately attempt to save their upcoming movie suburbicon a well a their hollywood careershe didnt do it out in the open matt damon on harvey weinstein httpstcofbsmwurca pictwittercomojxeptapz good morning america gma october it s indefensible that s the only word you can start with harvey s admitted to it and it s indefensible i ve known harvey for year he gave me my first big break a an actor in film on from dusk till dawn he gave me my first big break a a director with confession of a dangerous mind we ve had dinner we ve been on location together we ve had argument but i can tell you that i ve never seen any of this behavior everi ve heard rumor and the rumor in general started back in the s and they were that certain actress had slept with harvey to get a role it seemed like a way to smear the actress and demean them by saying that they didn t get the job based on their talent so i took those rumor with a grain of salt but the other part of this the part we re hearing now about eight woman being paid off i didn t hear anything about that and i don t know anyone that did that s a whole other level and there s no way you can reconcile that there s nothing to say except that it s indefensiblea lot of people are doing the you had to know thing right now and yes if you re asking if i knew that someone who wa very powerful had a tendency to hit on young beautiful woman sure but i had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight woman for their silence and that these woman were threatened and victimized i ve been talking with a lot of people about this and i don t know many people who knew of thatthere s an argument that everyone is complicit in it i suppose the argument would be that it s not just about hollywood but about all of u that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don t speak up you re complicit and there s no question about that,0,3,1.0,20,163,405,1043,855,165,23,48.0,44.0,194.3333333,4.388302972,0,watch sanctimonious antitrump hollywood implodesbest friend

education bachelors degree in business american university policy position cohns current job a director of the nec ha given him little reason to comment on monetary policy but he ha worried in the past that the fed ha been constrained by the action of other central bank trying to keep their currency weak in his own word if we woke up tomorrow and every central bank in the world raised their interest rate by percent the world would be a much better place pro to candidacy a practitioners understanding of financial market at a time the fed is attempting to unwind it bond portfolio bought after the financial crisis the trust of the white house and many congressional republican given cohns highprofile role in the trump administration con to candidacy no formal economics background at a time when the fed lean ever more on econometric model to decipher mixed signal in inflation and employment data a decadeslong career at goldman sachs and a personal fortune worth at least  million

regulation and ha discussed way to revise the volcker rule in his own word the committee ha been patient in raising rate and that patience ha paid dividend i would view it a appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates pro to candidacy an uncontroversial pick for the position could be the compromise who both replaces yellen and provides continuity only republican currently on the board of governor ha already helped guide the economy in it recovery and would likely get bipartisan support in congress familiarity with market and financial regulation may be considered a plus con to candidacy a a current fed member identified with the more centrist wing of the republican party may not provide enough of a change if trump decides to replace yellen expertise is less in formal economics and more in market and financial regulation which may seem too much of an overlap with the new vice chair for supervision randal quarles john taylor senior fellow at stanford universitys

simple research in the s transformed the debate over how central bank set rate support among key capitol hill republican who feel the fed ha too much discretion well known in central banking circle even if his idea are not universally supported con to candidacy a longterm member of the central banking and academic clique trump may want to disrupt advocacy of rulebased policy may land with a thud

policy stanford university law degree from harvard university policy position warsh feel the fed should not try to finetune the economy and argues policymakers have too much discretion he feel the fed should aim for inflation between and percent effectively lowering it inflation target in his own word we should not accept the feds newfound conviction that a very low neutral equilibrium real shortterm interest rate r is a fixed feature of future monetary policy the central bank and the academic community should engage in a fundamental rethinking of the feds strategy tool governance and communications pro to candidacy former banker and for several year former fed chair ben bernankes righthand man on financial market ha a familiarity with wall street wife jane lauder warsh is a daughter of cosmetic magnate ron lauder a longtime friend of trump served on the presidents economic advisory council before it disbanded con to candidacy may be seen a too hawkish by a president who call himself a low interest rate person not an academic economist like yellen or bernanke but ha still maintained u monetary policy need a full makeover worried about inflation even a the financial crisis hit and quit the fed over it second round of bondbuying a possible black mark against his judgment given the success of the quantitative easing program even while quitting over fed bond buying

report from the first presidential debateby pj o rourke on monday night presidential candidate donald trump and hillary clinton met for their first headtohead debate what wa the evening s big news deion jones returned a yard interception to score a touchdown and cap the atlanta falcon victory over the new orleans saint  i didn t get to see that though i wa watching the presidential debate so you didn t have to compared with the nfl matchup watching the presidential debate wa like standing on the sideline at a flag football game between a couple of montessori school the only talented player on the field wa nbc anchor lester holt and what holt wa talented at wa piling on trump and making late hit for team hillary the candidate themselves were no good trump ha the gut issue going for him but he can t articulate them well enough to make your reasoning fully agree with the feeling in the pit of your stomach and he ha trouble giving concise and tothepoint example of what he mean trump is too fond of the broad stroke he s trying to paint a detailed picture of what s wrong with american politics while using only a fourinch brush hillary is good with the detail too good detail are all she ha lot and lot of highly detailed little thises and thats like she s furnishing a dollhouse instead of filling the white house hillary kept saying i have a plan it s a phrase that always set off alarm for me people who really have a plan are acting on the plan not standing around saying they have one i have a plan is right up there with hold my beer and watch this who won the debate that assumes it wa a debate it wasn t it wa a tedious rehash of issue that both candidate had already made a hash of this wa interspersed with some namecalling that commentator characterized a heated harsh or even scorching which show what wimp these commentator are none of it would get you punched in the nose on the playground hillary had the best riposte she brought up the notion yet again that donald is someone who shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the nuclear launch code trump that s getting old hillary but good and trump had by far the best line he saved it for the very end hillary ha experience but it s bad experience the winner wa whomever you wanted to win a far a i can tell from clicking around source on the internet the candidate who won wa the candidate that the source in question had already decided to declare victorious it reminded me of soviet judge scoring olympic gymnastics back during the cold war thus the washington post and all it opinion columnist said hillary won ditto for the new york time and in cnn s instant viewer polling of respondent gave the laurel to hillary on the other hand the drudge report s instant polling awarded trump the prize by and charles krauthammer who to my mind is the smartest person on tv called the debate something like a draw did we learn anything from the presidential debate short answer no long answer no and yet the debate turned out to be highly informative if you turned the sound off the event wa broadcast with a split screen so that each candidate wa visible while the other wa talking or to use a technical term blabbing the blab wa dull but the expression on the candidate face were fascinating trump wa serious of mien he wa concentrating intently on what hillary wa saying he sometimes developed a little twitch of annoyance other time he wore a small frown of disagreement but mostly he looked deeply thoughtful and let s be frank this is a man who could stand to do a bit more deep thinking hillary is supposed to have a whole bunch of deep thought concerning her endlessly convoluted plan to fix all the problem under the sun but there she wa thoughtlessly making rude grimace whenever trump spoke mom always said you shouldn t make face because your face may get stuck that way hillary s face got stuck that way she spent the whole evening with a wipethatlookoffyourface look on her face she smirked she sneered she radiated smugness she repeatedly mugged for the camera with a ham actor s pantomime gasp of disbelief except she is no actor it came off like a cheap infomercial for new denture she indulged in nasty smile of condescension she adopted a pout that said what s a smarty like me doing with a dummy like him hillary had an air about her a if she just couldn t believe that somehow oh my gosh she had been dragged up on stage to debate a talking dog hillary had a plan for the debate of course she did hillary ha a plan for everything and she stuck to her plan the plan wa to be utterly dismissive of trump and anyone who back him and to treat every single thing he ha to say with total contempt a i ve said before i m not happy with either of these presidential candidate it s a tough election do you roll the dice with trump or do you let hillary just set the bone down on the table so you crap out again like always i don t care personally if hillary mock trump but i do care personally when the nature of democracy itself is mocked trump is a man who decisively triumphed in the contest for the republican party s presidential nomination and he is a of the latest polling in a dead heat with hillary in the presidential race when hillary doesn t treat trump with any measure of respect for the public support that he ha achieved she isn t insulting him she s insulting

paris reuters  french president emmanuel macron offered an ambitious vision for european renewal on tuesday calling for the eu to work more closely on defense and immigration and for the euro zone to have it own budget idea he may struggle to implement in a nearly twohour speech delivered two day after the german election in which chancellor angela merkel s conservative cducsu bloc scored it worst result since limiting her freedom to maneuver on europe the yearold french president held little back in term of sweep selfassurance and aspiration but at a time when europe is beset by tension between east and west and battling to overcome nearly a decade of draining economic crisis macron s earnest and at time highbrow discourse ran the risk of falling on deaf ear speaking at the sorbonne he portrayed europe a needing to relaunch itself saying that on issue a diverse a asylum border protection corporate tax intelligence sharing defense and financial stability it needed much deeper cooperation the only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a europe that is sovereign united and democratic the former investment banker and philosophy student said flanked by a french and a european union flag at the beginning of the next decade europe must have a joint intervention force a common defense budget and a joint doctrine for action in his run for the presidency macron made european reform a central plank of his centrist campaign and he and merkel have spoken frequently about their desire for france and germany the european union s two largest economy and often it engine of change to take the lead on integration but five month into his fiveyear term macron face the threat that merkel and looking to start her fourth term ha less capacity to move than either would have hoped her alliance is still the largest bloc in the bundestag but to build a working majority she will likely have to form a coalition with the green and the liberal free democrat fdp who are opposed to many of macron s idea german foreign minister sigmar gabriel a senior member of the social democrat spd hailed macron s speech a passionate plea against nationalism and for europe he can count on u said gabriel whose party ha ruled out being part of a new grand coalition rather than tailoring his speech to fit the contour of what the fdp the green or merkel may have wanted to hear macron kept his vision broad and farreaching while also detailing some specific idea for an improved euro zone a budget can only go handinhand with strong political leadership led by a common finance minister and a strong parliamentary supervision at the european level he said emphasizing the need for democratic accountability the fiscally conservative fdp dislike the idea of a euro zone budget or any facility that may lead to financial transfer from wealthier euro zone country to poorer one a well a the possibility of national debt being pooled the party ha also called for phasing out europe s esm bailout fund which macron want to turn into a european monetary fund and want to see change to eu treaty that would allow country to leave the euro zone you don t strengthen europe with new pot of money alexander lambsdorff an fdp member in the european parliament said on twitter in reaction to macron s speech in a statement issued by the fdp in berlin lambsdorff said the problem in europe is not a lack of public fund but the lack of reform a euro zone budget would set exactly the wrong incentive not shying away from addressing germany directly even a it try to resolve the fallout from sunday s election macron set an objective that the two country completely integrate their market and corporate rule by we share the same european ambition and i know her commitment to europe he said of merkel i m proposing to germany a new partnership we will not agree on everything not immediately but we will discus everything in berlin on monday merkel said it wa important to move beyond catchphrase and provide detail on how europe could be improved it wa not immediately clear whether macron had managed to go beyond slogan a far a merkel wa concerned but martin selmayr the chief of staff of european commission president jeanclaude juncker said the proposal to reinforce the euro zone would be discussed alongside juncker s own at a euro zone summit planned for december italy s eu affair minister sandro gozi said the speech would inspire european leader into action an excellent speech by emmanuel macron on reviving the european union let s work on this together starting tomorrow at the lyon summit he said referring to a meeting of the italian and french leader to discus industrial policy macron said he hoped his idea would be taken into account in germany s coalition building negotiation those talk are not expected to begin until midoctober and may take several month some had said i should wait for the coalition talk to be concluded macron said adding had he done so the reaction in berlin would have been your proposal are great but it s too late the coalition deal already lay out what will we do on europe for the next four

not only disrupting some neocon regime change project such a the proxy war in syria but also political development in the west such a donald trump s election and afd s rise in germanythe atlantic council s digital lab claimed according to the post editorial that in the final hour of the german campaign online supporter of the afd began warning their base of possible election fraud and the online alarm were driven by anonymous troll account and boosted by a russianlanguage botnet of course the post evinces no evidence tying any of this to the russian government or to president vladimir putin it is the nature of mccarthyism that actual evidence is not required just heavy breathing and dark suspicion for those of u who operate web site troll some volunteer and some professional have become a common annoyance and they represent many political outlook not just russianplus it is standard procedure these day for campaign to issue lastminute alarm to their supporter about possible election fraud to raise doubt about the result should the outcome be disappointingthe u government ha engaged in precisely this strategy around the world having prous party not only complain about election fraud but to take to the street in violent protest to impugn the legitimacy of election outcome that u strategy ha been applied to place such a ukraine the orange revolution in iran the green revolution in russia the snow revolution in and many other locationspreelection alert also have become a feature in u election even in when both donald trump and hillary clinton raised question about the legitimacy of the balloting albeit for different reasonsyet instead of seeing the afd maneuver a a typical ploy by a relatively minor party and the german election outcome a an understandable reflection of voter discontent and weariness over merkel s three term a chancellor the atlantic council and the post see russian under every bed and particularly putinloving to hate putinin the world of neocon propaganda putin ha become the great b te noire since he ha frustrated a variety of neocon scheme he helped head off a major u military strike against syria in he aided president obama in achieving the iran nuclear agreement in  putin opposed and to a degree frustrated the neoconsupported coup in ukraine in and he ultimately supplied the air power that defeated neoconbacked rebel force in syria in so the post and the neocon want putin gone and they have used gauzy allegation about russian meddling in the u and other election a the new propaganda theme to justify destabilizing russia with economic sanction and if possible engineering another regime change project in moscownone of this is even secret carl gershman the neocon president of the usgovernmentfunded national endowment for democracy publicly proclaimed the goal of ousting putin in an oped in the washington post writing the united state ha the power to contain and defeat this danger the issue is whether we can summon the will to do so but the way neocon propaganda work is that the u and it ally are always the victim of some nefarious enemy who must be thwarted to protect all that is good in the world in other word even a ned and other usfunded operation take aim at putin and russia russia and putin must be transformed into the aggressor mr putin would like nothing better than to generate doubt fog crack and uncertainty around the german pillar of europe the post editorial said he relish infiltrating chaos and mischief into open society in this case supporting the farright afd is extraordinarily cynical given how many million of russian died to defeat the fascist seven decade ago not to belabor the point but there is no credible evidence that putin did any of this there is a claim by the virulently antirussian atlantic council that some anonymous troll account promoted some afd complaint about possible voter fraud and that it wa picked up by a russianlanguage botnet even if that is true and the atlantic council is far from an objective source where is the link to putinnot everything that happens in russia a nation of million people is ordered by putin but the post would have you believe that it is it is the centerpiece of this neocon conspiracy theorysilencing dissentsimilarly any american who question this propaganda immediately is dismissed a a kremlin stooge or a russian propagandist another ugly campaign spearheaded by the post and the neocon again no evidence is required just some analysis that what you re saying somehow parallel something putin ha saidon tuesday in what amounted to a companion piece for the editorial a post article again pushed the unproven suspicion about russian operative buying  in facebook ad from into to supposedly influence u politics once again no evidence requiredin the article the post also reminds it reader that moscow ha a history of focusing on social inequity in the u which get u back to the comparison between the old mccarthyism and the newyes it s true that the soviet union denounced america s racial segregation and cited that ugly feature of u society in expressing solidarity with the american civil right movement and national liberation struggle in africa it s also true that american communist collaborated with the domestic civil right movement to promote racial integrationthat wa a key reason why j edgar hoover s fbi targeted martin luther king jr and other africanamerican leader because of their association with known or suspected communist similarly the reagan administration resisted support for nelson mandela because his african national congress accepted communist support in it battle against south africa s apartheid whitesupremacist regimeinterestingly one of the argument from liberal national democrat in opposing segregation in the s wa that the repression of american black undercut u diplomatic effort to develop ally in africa in other word soviet and communist criticism of america s segregation actually helped bring about the demise of that offensive systemyet king s association with alleged communist remained a talking point of diehard segregationist even after his assassination when they opposed creating a national holiday in his honor in the sthese parallel between the old mccarthyism and the new mccarthyism are implicitly acknowledged in the post s news article on tuesday which cite putin s criticism of police killing of unarmed american black a evidence that he is meddling in u politics since taking office putin ha on occasion sought to spotlight racial tension in the united state a a mean of shaping perception of american society the article state putin injected himself in into the race debate after protest broke out in ferguson mo over the fatal shooting of michael brown an african american by a white police officer do you believe that everything is perfect now from the point of view of democracy in the united state putin told cbs s minute program if everything wa perfect there wouldn t be the problem of ferguson there would be no abuse by the police but our task is to see all these problem and respond properly the post s speculative point seems to be that putin s response included having russian operative buy some ad on facebook to exploit these racial tension but there is no evidence to support that conspiracy theoryhowever a this antirussia hysteria spread we may soon see american who also protest the police killing of unarmed black men denounced a putin s fellowtravelers much a king and other civil right leader were smeared a communist dupe ignoring realityso instead of democrat and chancellor merkel looking in the mirror and seeing the real reason why many white workingclass voter are turning toward populist and extremist alternative they can simply blame putin and continue a crackdown on internetbased dissent a the work of russian operative already under the guise of combating russian propaganda and fake news google facebook and other tech giant have begun introducing algorithm to hunt down and marginalize news that challenge official u government narrative on hotbutton issue such a ukraine and syria again no evidence is required just the fact that putin may have said something similaras democrat liberal and even some progressive join in this russiagate hysteria driven by their hatred of donald trump and his supposedly fascistic tendency they might want to consider whom they ve climbed into bed with and what these neocon have in mind for the futurearguably if fascism or totalitarianism come to the united state it is more likely to arrive in the guise of protecting democracy from russia or another foreign adversary than from a realitytv clown like donald trumpthe new mccarthyism with it orwellianstyle algorithm might seem like a clever way to neutralize or maybe even help oust trump but long after trump is gone a structure for letting the neocon and the mainstream medium monopolize

attended meeting with tillerson say they find him sociable and a man of substance whose direct manner and probing question reflect his training a an engineer seeking to solve problem rather than play politics the veteran oil executive also made a good impression on his first foreign trip to a group of summit in bonn germany last week four senior diplomat who met him told reuters they were relieved to find that he wa pragmatic and open to dialogue yet a key concern for u diplomat is how effective his team can be in shaping foreign policy in the new administration just two state department position of key post requiring executive branch nomination have been filled according to the nonpartisan partnership for public service  tillersons and that of u ambassador to the united nation for example tillerson still ha no deputy after trump rejected his top choice elliott abrams people want to back him one veteran senior official said about the former exxon mobil bos but people are feeling that this building is being stripped said the official referring to a sense that with so many top position vacant the state department is not fully equipped to help make policy in the new administration there is also unease over possible deep staff cut and the future of some department two people said employee in the bureau of management and resource were told to apply for other position within the state department hammond tillersons aide said no decision had been taken to close that division on one recent matter of longstanding u foreign policy tillerson appeared to be sidelined on feb while tillerson wa at a dinner with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu in a state department dining room news headline emerged suggesting the united state wa backing away from supporting a twostate solution for israeli and palestinian the twostate solution is the bedrock of the international communitys policy for a settlement between israel and the palestinian but trump suggested last week he wa open to abandoning it if both side agree no one had been informed of any change in policy and the secretary wa about to leave on his first major trip said one senior state department official referring to tillersons visit to bonn tillersons acting deputy tom shannon also did not take part in trumps meeting with netanyahu at the white house the following day when his bos wa on his way to europe according to one u official it wa unclear whether tillerson had been left out of the loop deliberately or by accident said two official a white house official told reuters he did not know whether tillerson wa briefed in advance in response to broader concern about communication between the state department and the new administration he said both coordinated very well there are open line of communication in both directions the official who declined to be named said the white house and the state department coordinate closely across a full range of issue that concern both organizationsto be sure on another important issue tillerson had his say in persuading trump to back washingtons stance on one china policy which acknowledges beijings position that taiwan is part of it trump ha in the past appeared to question whether the united state would continue to respect that hammond said tillerson wa on the phone with trump several time a day this is the general style of the president to have quick checkin with people get peoples advice on things he said information for ceo flow up and a a former ceo tillerson understands that tillerson ha said little publicly since he started and his aide are quick to draw a contrast between him and predecessor john kerry a former senator and presidential candidate who reveled in extensive foreign travel and deal making tillerson is not john kerry it is unfair to compare the two said hammond he will quietly go about his job a a counselor and advisor to the president for tillersons state department the concern is how to maintain a similar degree of communication with an administration grappling with a succession of crisis nine official involved in foreign policy and security issue said over the past month the white house ha faced legal setback over it immigration order the resignation of trumps national security adviser and an investigation into possible link between his campaign and russian intelligence

much a percent industry official said last week the president said he favored an import tax that could be adjusted to reflect the country of origins tax rate for u product the decision by retailer to forestall supply chain investment in country such a bolivia and romania to focus on lobbying congress show how trumps ambitious agenda ha instilled a new level of risk operating outside u border but the vagueness around the tax proposal and whether they may ever be implemented mean retail industry executive are still not willing to change their operating infrastructure the retail industry leader association which is leading the industry lobbying effort ha conducted meeting with lawmaker since december focusing on the cost of a new tax and encouraging lawmaker who oppose the tax prospect for a quick passage of a tax bill took a hit last month when the republican attempt to overhaul the national healthcare law failed to get a vote in the u house of representative trump and republican leader

one outlier is luxury handbag maker rebecca minkoff which sell it own product and supply other retailer like nordstrom inc jwnn and amazoncom inc amzno the prospect of a u border tax factored into it recent decision to supply u customer from europe a it mitigates logistics cost to supply to the united state according to uri minkoff the firms founder and ceo the process ha intensified in the past six months said minkoff the decision to bank more on the lobby effort to kill support for the tax idea come after retailer spent the last few month considering whether to move some of their production to supply base like bolivia brazil and other south american country with low wage rate a well a european country like hungary bulgaria and the czech republic industry source told reuters a return to the united state wa also a consideration the source said shifting production from existing supply base like china is costly may involve intellectual property issue and disrupts longterm supply contract making it hard to plan and execute such move two industry source said consultant have told retailer they could mitigate shipping cost enough to offset any border tax while avoiding the cost of moving production into the u the source said but so far they are not proceeding with major supply chain change according to retailer and industry consultant walmart is not ready to spend money to

ap published an article today that attempt to discredit the very popular fox news cable network over their coverage of the seth rich murder instead of questioning fox news coverage of the seth rich murder case perhaps american should be questioning why the ap is not covering the suspicious case of the seth rich murderan excerpt from the ridiculous ap story including the photoshopped photo they used to discredit fox can be found below how professional is this photo david bauder the writer for this ap hit piece on fox news actually said that he hope for the sake of their more liberal host like shepard smith that the story isn t true yet the ap publishes a huge picture of fox news with an electronic banner that appears to be on the front of the fox news studio the fake news medium and trump illegible we re pretty sure you don t post an inflammatory photoshopped picture like the one below if you re not trying to discredit fox newsnew york ap thing had started settling down following a tumultuous year at fox news channel before it wa hit with a cover headline in the new york daily news fake news channel and question about the independence of it journalist on wednesdaya defamation lawsuit filed this week accuses the network of making up quote and pushing a false story that benefit president donald trump even inviting the chief executive into the editorial processin essence fox is accused of creating fake news to debunk a story trump ha complained is fake news the charge is a very serious one if substantiated said kathleen hall jamieson communication professor and director of the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania it speaks to the credibility of fox a a news organization in a year fox ha been hit by the forced departure of it late chairman roger ailes and most popular personality bill o reilly following harassment charge ailes successor bill shine resigned primetime host megyn kelly and greta van susteren left and there have been several sexual harassment and race discrimination lawsuitsyet the network s conservative audience ha remained mostly loyal while not a dominant a it wa before msnbc s resurgence in the past few month fox ranked a the most popular primetime network on cable television in july for the fifth time in the past seven month the nielsen company saidfox host like sean hannity tucker carlson and the team on trump s favorite morning show fox friend make no secret of their opinion and those show have strongly backed trump in his first six month fox though is different from some politically oriented news organization in maintaining a staff of respected journalist who try to play it straight people like shepard smith chris wallace bret baier and john robertswe hate to tell you ap but about of fox news viewer wish shepard smith would go away that s the side of fox that would be most damaged if the allegation are proven true since they involved the reporting of an investigative news story on the network s web site not material from it opinion program any news organization that ha any aspiration of being bona fide expects the public to take what they are saying seriously not that they are being fed something that is being made up said paul levinson chairman of fordham university s communication department i m no fan of fox but i m hoping this turn out not to be the case the private detective who filed the lawsuit rod wheeler said he wa paid to investigate the death of dnc staffer seth rich by a wealthy gop donor anxious to establish a link between rich and the leak of email damaging to hillary clinton s campaign the idea wa if that could be done it would end story about trump s possible collusion with russiansreally ap do you have proof of your allegation that the seth rich story wa manufactured to end story about trump s possible collusion with russian so far there hasn t been one iota of truth that substantiates the leftist medium s fabricated trumprussia collusion story but there seems to be an awful lot of evidence pointing to the fact that the former dnc staffer seth rich s murder wa not about a robbery on june breitbart news caught the ap publishing a totally manufactured story about a meeting between trump s epa administrator and dow chemical s ceo that never happened breitbart june the associated press is at it again pushing more fake news sadly the oncegreat news wire service is trying to cover up it mistake nearly the exact mistake that cost three editorial staffer at cnn their job in a scandal that first exploded a week ago todaya breitbart news investigation ha led to the correction by the associated press which originally resisted of the fake news it printed a deeper question of responsibility accountability and journalistic ethic consume the ap heading into fourth of july weekendthis time the associated press invented an imaginary meeting between epa administrator scott pruitt and dow chemical ceo andrew liveris and then alleged that some kind of impropriety happened a a resultthis is exactly the same mistake cnn made a week ago when it alleged that anthony scaramucci the founder of skybridge capital and an associate and ally of president donald trump held meeting with russian investment fund leader and wa under investigation by the senate intelligence committee and treasury department a a resulta breitbart news investigation uncovered that no such meeting took place the senate intelligence committee wa not investigating the matter and the treasury department had already at the urging of sen elizabeth warren dma to now treasury secretary steven mnuchin before trump s inauguration looked into it and determined the matter to be entirely without merit the very fake news scandal that is consuming cnn right now is the biggest scandal in the network s history and come a medium dcwide find themselves under intense scrutiny amid a litany of industry mistakesbreitbart news s investigation into cnn s very fake news piece forced the network to retract it and ha led to the resignation of three top official from inside cnn now that the associated press ha made literally the exact same mistake with different actor and player alleging a meeting took place that never occurred something that supposedly led to something untoward that also didn t happen the news wire service is not stepping up and holding it staff to the same level of accountability the only difference between the cnn scandal and this ap scandal is that the ap did not also inaccurately allege the existence of

position to represent the school might face some form of discipline if they were to say call the president a baboon reference multiple awful stereotype about black people and complain that a colored is running the country unfortunately the school is continuing a proud american tradition almost a ancient a the sentiment these student were busted expressing protecting sport team from facing the music for their actionslast may the team traveled to washington dc where the conversation in a pitchersonly groupme chat swiftly went from where do we eat to donald trump s inner thought one player suggested the kfc in the white house you know because all black people eat fried chicken har har another helpfully added that they got river of the grape kind there another reference to a popular africanamerican stereotype among stupid people i heard they got a colored running the country someone else said this tru another player replied unfortunately it is the asker responded fcking watermelon eating baboon and luke sommerfeld needed a macbook chargervia deadspinit s unclear if luke ever found his charger but one thing is for certain the pitcher on the saint louis university baseball team are a bunch of racist fcksone of the player texted a screenshot of the message to his roommate former team manager brendan twomey who held on to it for almost a year until his girlfriend saw it on her phone together the two filed a complaint to the university deadspin give a brief rundown of the event that transpired the report wa filed on april on april twomey and his girlfriend spoke to a university investigatoron april after not having heard anything about the status of the investigation twomey and his girlfriend sent the image to the black student alliance who posted it to their facebook page dr mona hick slu s dean of student said there had been a miscommunication and a meeting to discus the case wa supposed to be held the next daybut according to slu s biasrelated incident report log the investigation had been closed on april and labeled not applicable for discipline when i received that screenshot obviously i knew it wa wrong but i wa in a tough situation because i didn t want to necessarily hurt anybody twomey said a he explained his reasoning for holding onto the screenshot for so long you become close to the player because you do spend so much time with them so you overlook that at the same time i felt extremely disrespected i knew there should be some sort of punishment but i didn t know how to go about that he addedasked about her decision to fail to punish her racist baseball player hick wa full of excuse if i were to directly state to you you suck because of all of your social identity that god gave you that would be wrong that would require some adjudication hick said in defense of giving her school s pitching rotation a pas on the horrible thing they said we also need to respect law this wa a private conversation or at least the perception of private between ingroup party hick did not explain what privacy law were broken though the answer to that is none one of the player sent the screenshot to someone who showed it to someone else no one hacked anyone no one took someone s phone without permission all of the information wa given willingly but hey she wa trying to protect these student right to privacy rather than avoiding a disruption of the season that might lead to the team failing to make it to the playoff two year in a row ultimately they did not rightinstead the player chose to participate in a facilitated dialogue about what they did and the team s four captain wrote a letter to the school newspaper apologizing for that racist thing their teammate did the leader and captain of the team would like to extend an apology to anyone offended by the bias message we too are frustrated and feel that the comment do not accurately reflect the value that we hold so far the only person to face any real punishment is twomey who ha been harassed since he blew the whistle on the player racist conduct the riverfront time reportstwo day later twomey say he awoke to discover his roommate had sloshed chewing tobacco spit on the floor outside his bedroom door a well a the kitchen sink fingernail clipping had been prominently placed on the towel twomey us to clean his glassesin a wednesday facebook post from pulphus twomey s roommate wa identified a slu pitcher brett shimanovsky in fact shimanovsky appears to be the very same playerroommate who earlier provided twomey with a screenshot of the racist chat thread twomey himself declined to answer question about his roommate s identity but say the roommate ha since voluntarily moved out shimanovsky did not respond to a message seeking comment i consider this retaliation for filing a bias incident report twomey say in a video documenting shimanovsky s actionstwomey say he is disappointed that the university ha not in any way punished the player whom he say should have been forced to miss a conference tournament but that clearly wa not an option in the eye of the school of course he call the captain letter an insult though he note that the team s coach darin hendrickson did take the time to discus the issue with him he said he wa aware there wa a culture problem on the baseball team a culture problem of entitlement privilege and immaturity he also said it wa one of his biggest regret that he hadn t recruited more diverse player twomey recalled he add that there are racial issue that need to be confrontedit started a dialogue and frankly it need to be continued the student say hopefully this issue will light a fire under the university and get them to really dedicate themselves to the slu mission of

he did not appear to have suffered serious head wound yet she is skeptical he died of heart problem and suspect the attack triggered problem that took time to unfold my brother never complained about heart problem she told reuters saying doctor had given him a clean bill of health in a checkup a recently a this spring my brother wa into crosscountry skiing flew a glider did parachute jump and cycled at a semiprofessional level i absolutely link my brother s death with the attack russia s liberal opposition ha no seat in parliament and scant hope of mounting a serious challenge to putin

crimea and support for prorussian separatist in eastern ukraine prokremlin politician often cast anyone critical of the authority a the enemy within critic say such rhetoric is fuelling attack against the opposition and that those who carry them out feel a sense of impunity because they are rarely punished navalny became temporarily blind in one eye in april after having caustic liquid thrown at him soon afterwards a progovernment tv channel broadcast footage of navalny s attacker running away from the scene but blurred out his face opposition activist identified the man a a member of a radical group investigator said there wa not enough evidence for a prosecution in another incident nikolai lyaskin a navalny ally wa hit over the head with an iron bar in moscow last month an assault
